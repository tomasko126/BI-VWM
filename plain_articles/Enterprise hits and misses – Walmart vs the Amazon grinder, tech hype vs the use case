diginomica hit: Walmart’s digital ambitions – and existential threats
quotage: “Evaluating the SaaS risks going into any software agreement is never easy and there are inevitable compromises. Those I have outlined are among those that are less talked about than the usual fare around security but are of significant importance.”
myPOV: Using Stuart’s Merchandising to the Millennial – Walmart’s CX gambit as a launch, Den takes an unsparing look at Walmart’s five existential threats. The company causing Walmart’s friction? Yup, Amazon. While Amazon is building for growth, Walmart is catering to the value investor, tying its hands on spending. Contrast Amazon’s global virtual network with Walmart’s U.S.-based play. Amazon is one of the few companies that race to the bottom with Walmart on pricing when need be. And then, Den argues, there is Echo, a big play for product/service consumption. – you get the idea.
I am pals with a curmodgeon who prides himself on using a ten year old XP laptop for his publishing business. He shelled out for an Amazon Echo and swears by it. Meanwhile, Walmart botched chances lure me to in-store pickup. They couldn’t tie the inventory to the store – something our Brian Sommer already nailed. New York Time pasted Amazon for its culture problems – let’s see their piece on Walmart next. The energy level of the staff at my store is flatlined, and you can’t blame ’em. Have a look at the “hiring center”. Not a confidence-inducing image for the talent wars, eh?

Responding to Stuart’s piece, Michael K raised this point: “From a consumer standpoint, competition is a wonderful thing therefore; I really do wish Walmart could get this figured out.” Stuart’s last word: “Big job ahead.” Indeed.
diginomica five: my completely subjective “top five” stories on diginomica this week,

American Express GBT implements Jive to democratise enterprise collaboration – Derek’s back from his favorite American city Las Vegas (that’s sarcasm folks), with a slew of stories from Jive’s annual user conference. Neat use case about change of top-down communication/culture.
7 disruption tips for the digital zeitgeist from Aviva’s CDO – Phil’s got your disruption fix with a meaty listicle (yes, there is such a thing!). I especially liked “ruffle feathers,” as in, “We’re not getting enough complaints about you – you’re not being disruptive enough.” That’s one problem diginomica doesn’t have, though we have others. 🙂
Apple v the FBI overshadows Obama’s SXSW government digital transformation vision – SXSW happened this week – a few of you may still be nursing festival hangovers. We’re not huge SXSW peeps at diginomica, but Stuart picked up on an under-served SXSW narrative that got a bit lost on the party bus, as we continue our Apple-FBI-encryption analysis from the enterprise angle.
Breeding a Babel Fish for Internet of Things analytics – Not many can tie the Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy to IoT analysis, but it’s just a casual flex of the literary analogies for Martin.
What do Trump, Gartner, Kellogg and diginomica have in common? – A very Den headline for a very Den article. Well worth your read as he ties thought patterns into cohesion. Bonus: comment from Gartner’s Hank Barnes who is either amused or alarmed that his work was tied into Trump’s campaign…

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. Here’s my top choices from our vendor coverage:

CEO Elisa Steele’s plans for a ‘simpler’ Jive continue to gain momentum – Derek’s keynote analysis hones in on the future of collaboration, Jive style.
Jive leadership not worried about Facebook at Work or Slack – On LinkedIn, Greg Chase responded to my post by saying, “They’re totally different, and Slack is just beginning to show its warts as a community platform.” Not sure I agree with Mr. Chase but Derek’s comparison frames a fun/worthy debate.
“Not quite the end of the beginning” for Oracle’s cloud journey – Stuart balances “impressive” SaaS/PaaS growth rates with this: “You can lead a customer to the cloud and you can probably persuade them to ‘drink’, but they’re still going to want to do it at their own pace.” Customers just don’t behave the way Wall Street investors want them to!

A few more vendor picks, without my running banter:



Adobe’s cloud gambit pays off as creative revenues soar 44% – Stuart
Equinix and Facebook offer users the glue for an eco-system – Martin



Jon’s grab bag – Stuart continued his stellar coverage of Salesforce/tech companies response to legislative bigotry in Georgia still on his mind – Benioff to move Connections conference unless anti-gay bill vetoed. Kurt issued an enterprisey take on open compute, What’s the Open Compute Project and why should you care?
Den calls BS on disruption, and not for the last time, in Do we really want disruptors? Maybe not as much as is claimed. Ouch: “I can only imagine the frustration among leaders who know that change is imperative yet are blocked by organization layers that seem hell bent on preserving the status quo.” Den has an edgy take on a podcast I did recently – and a whole lot more – in Trump hasn’t earned a penny in media, it’s entertainment – lessons for enterprise.
Comment your tuckus off! Hey peeps – did you know as part of our makeover we tricked out our comment system? You can now do in-line commenting, just follow the shiny red icons. We made this easy so please let us have it (your comments, that is). Den has the skinny for ya in the cleverly-titled No Comment. Others are backing off of on-site comments, we’re doubling down – let’s do this…
Best of the rest
Interviews with Accuride and Intel – use cases, Mirchandani style
quotage: “Because Accuride was built through acquisition, each of the different businesses brought together had its own way of doing things, and some of our brands were using older ERP systems that didn’t fit with our business vision. Data was disconnected from the reality of our plants, and we were spending more time gathering and interrogating data than we were making decisions with it.” Paul Wright, Accuride, via Vinnie Mirchandani
myPOV: You can tell with Vinnie Mirchandani is gearing up for another book – he starts posting interviews that shed light on his obsessions. This week we’ve got a twofer: Interview with Chip Coyle of Infor: High Touch in High Tech and Interview with Paul Wright of Accuride : Steady Wheels Will Get You Far. We get plenty of regurgitated vendor messaging in the enterprise press, but we don’t get enough discerning use cases and interviews.
I enjoyed the Accuride piece, which Mirchandani conducted at the Plex user conference. It speaks to an axe I like to grind, which is that a bi-modal approach that puts ERP in the legacy bin doesn’t work. When it comes to ERP, it’s modernize of bust. Or squander your digital budget trying to tie collaboration and analytics into aging systems.
Other standouts

The eShares offer letter: write like a human, not an HR robot – Josh Bernoff of withoutbullshit.com continues his hot streak of hits/misses appearance (on the good side, no less) with this useful take. Bernoff tees off with a winner: “Bullshit gathers where lawyers and human resources meet.” The we learn about how eShares avoids that corporate abyss with an amazingly transparent offer letter than includes… an org chart! (And “how we determined your salary,” etc). HR take note…
The autonomous cars debate, and other SXSQ highlights – Vinnie Mirchandani nabs the rare hat trick with a ditty on autonomous cars, and whether they will take 3 or 30 years to deliver (he doesn’t take a position just yet). Mirchandani pulls from an SXSW presso on self-driving cars by Google’s Chris Urmson. Kimberly Mok added some AI smart car flavor with Driverless Cars Recognize Peds Better With Deep Learning Algorithm. (peds = pedestrians for those un-hipsters like me). Finally, you can get your SXSQ conference end keynote replay here (full disclosure, I haven’t streamed it yet).

Honorable mention
Satya Nadella’s Bold Plan To Future-Proof Microsoft: Embrace Apple iOS, Android And Now Linux – missed this ‘un last week. Not brilliant but a handy overview of Microsoft’s judo moves.
Election Season 2016: Is Infor a Legitimate Third Party Candidate? – my (quick) POV: yup, but it’s not a three horse race. And fortunately there’s no… well, we’ll just leave that alone.
Oracle’s Q3 Results: The Key Takeaways – Speaking of Larry Ellison (lol), here’s a speedy take with earning quips from the #ensw media maestro.
Future of SAP and SuccessFactors Consulting 2016 – SuccessFactors Talent Management (Part 3) – The definitive series rolls on…
Comparing Software using Peer Reviews – Some may find the checklist detail mind-numbing, but if you’re looking hard at peer reviews you’ll want this nitty gritty.
The Amazon Tax – Another take to flesh out the retail disruption theme. And AWS in context also.
Whiffs
So I really wanted to have a go at Medium for their abandonment of Holacracy – a management cult religion methodology I am deeply skeptical of. But alas I cannot. The blog post by Medium’s Andy Doyle was frustratingly sensible. And the thoughtful comments show why Medium has the best commenting platform on the web.
But I think I can call Xbox’s trade show retrograde a legit whiff:

“Xbox Has Apologized For Hiring Sexy Schoolgirl Dancers For A Conference” https://t.co/axwZo9UHiI -> “This is Spinal Tap,” err, Xbox
— Jon Reed (@jonerp) March 19, 2016
My quips are nothing compared to the wrath of female gamers:

THIS is why we have a shit rate of women in games. Because these fucking boys clubs that make people unwelcome. Fuck you @Microsoft #GDC16
— Kamina Vincent (@spamoir) March 18, 2016
Blammo! Microsoft’s apology was a odd mix of accountability and throw-a-low-level-staffer-under-the-bus wet noodle. Sounds like a lesson learned, but I thought we had this class(less) before.
I had more whiffs for ya, but due to an extended downtime interlude with Comcast I’m outta time. Can we call it good for this week? See you next week.

Which #ensw pieces of merit did I miss? Let us know in the comments.
