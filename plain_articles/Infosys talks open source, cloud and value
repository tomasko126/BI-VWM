Open source software has been the backbone of what constitutes the modern internet for many years. But it is only in recent times that we’ve seen enterprises actively taking on open source as a deliberate choice, at scale and for business critical functions. Now we are seeing third party consulting organizations taking on open source for their customer solution building.
Last year, when Infosys hired Abdul Razack to own the company’s platform division, he came with a mandate to use open source first. Eleven months on and Infosys Information Platform (IIP) is flourishing with 120 projects on the go, some proofs of concept, many moving to production, but with open source at their heart in most situations.
I sat down with Razack to get his take on why this is important and what it means for customers. The recording we made talks to two questions: why open source and what are customers doing?

It’s also logical that Infosys would use open source to deliver on its promise of price competitive, performant solutions.
