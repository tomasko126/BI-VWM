Your life, post-GDPR via Phil Fershtâ€™s LinkedIn feed
In an effort to lighten the load that is the tsunami of GDPR emails weâ€™re all receiving, Twitter has your back. Starting with:

GDPR emails: MAKE THEM STOP
â€” The Frugality (@TheFrugality) May 22, 2018

â€¦so screamed a million voices into the internet ether. But then Iâ€™m quite pleased in a way because like this person, I am learning about all the services I (inadvertently) signed up for when trying to get information:

Why yes, of course I still want to hear from the company where I bought one pair of shoes in 2005 #GDPR
â€” Holly Brockwell (@holly) May 22, 2018

Maggie Fox puts it more succinctly than I could ever do:

If nothing else, GDPR is reminding me of how many dumbass organizations I have given my email address to.

Need to work on your inner GDPR anger issues? This helps:

It sure feels good hitting the delete button. Right? And, as this person points out â€“ there is upside to this crap:

GDPR is the cleanse my inbox needed and I was always too lazy to do myself
â€” Rachel â˜• (@nospaceformilk) May 22, 2018

Then thereâ€™s the emails we get from those we are in regular contact with and to whom weâ€™ve given consent. You have to wonder what the legal brains are doing â€“ other than bilking their clients for fees.
Advice â€“ check this story out from The Guardian. Or check this one from Madeline Bennett which is currently going gangbusters according to our visitor data. Hint â€“ Madelineâ€™s story tells you what you need to do.
For those who are really are trying to take GDPR seriously and handle it in a manner that makes sense to everyone, this is your go to source â€“ itâ€™s been a life saver for me, even if I have had my own share of sleep deprivation:

Back to the Twitterati.
Wanna prize for a great GDPR email? How about this?

And the prize for the best #GDPR email subject line goes to @Harlands_NE. pic.twitter.com/ZHjT3G8yhV

And of course we all need more kitties:

Thereâ€™s no need to opt-in to continue hearing updates from me ahead of #GDPR. When you run the place you can decide which rules to ignore, which for me as a cat is all of them pic.twitter.com/wQh1SfWqoD
â€” Palmerston the Cat (@PalmerstonFOCat) May 22, 2018

But then you canâ€™t please everybody I guess:

Whoever thought GDPR was a good idea, go trying running your own business, you pen-pushing prat.
â€” Nick Lincoln (@HatTipNick) May 22, 2018

Iâ€™ve saved the best advice for last:

Welcome to the #GDPR countdown week. If youâ€™re smart you take Friday off and bury yourself in a hole somewhere far away from the internet! ðŸ˜¤
â€” Daniel Freytag (@FRYTG) May 22, 2018

That would be me tooâ€¦
