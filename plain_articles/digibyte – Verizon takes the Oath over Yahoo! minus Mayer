Marissa Mayer
One of the most disruptive brand companies in digital.
That’s Oath. Apparently.
Oath is to be the new overall brand name for Verizon’s combo of AOL and Yahoo! – or rather, Oath – A Verizon Company.
The name leaked publicly yesterday via Business Insider, which probably resulted in a bad day for campaign planners at Verizon/AOL who were forced into confirming the story.

Underneath the umbrella name will be “20+ brands”, according to Tim Armstrong, AOL CEO. That appears to suggest that the portfolio of Yahoo! offerings will continue with their own identies once Verizon closes its $4.45 billion acquisition, possibly as early as next month.
Meanwhile Recode reports perhaps the least surprising aspect of the whole long-running saga, namely that Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer will not be taking the oath with the new organisation. With her severance package a topic of considerable discussion and debate, it sounds like it’s down to haggling over the final numbers at this stage.
My take
Someone, somewhere was paid a lot of money to come up with Oath.
Let’s just leave that there and let Twitter do what it does best.
