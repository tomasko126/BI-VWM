One day a merchant came to the village to buy monkeys. He announced that he will buy the monkeys at $100 each. Villagers wondered why somebody would want to buy stray monkeys at $100 each? Still, a few people caught some monkeys and sold them to the merchant. This news spread and more people caught monkeys and sold them to the merchant.
Then, the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys at $200 each. The villagers sold the remaining monkeys at $200 each. Then the merchant announced he will buy at $500 each! It took a lot of effort but finally, the villagers caught the remaining six monkeys, and they received $500 each.

Then the merchant announced he will buy monkeys at $1,000 each! The villagers were very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell. Then, the merchant’s employee told the villagers that he will secretly sell some monkeys at $700 so that the villagers can make $300. Rich people bought monkeys in big lots. Poor people borrowed money and bought monkeys.
The villagers waited for the merchant to return. But nobody came. They ran to the employee’s house. But he was missing too.
Too late, the villagers realized that they have bought useless stray monkeys at $700 each but are unable to sell them.
Bitcoin is the next monkey business. It will make a lot of people bankrupt and a few people filthy rich.
