At its annual user conference in Las Vegas this week,  OpenText is giving conference goers a sneak peek at the upcoming releases of its wide range of suites and solutions. There are a lot of new features coming to all OpenText Suite solutions, all with an eye to helping organizations’ digital transformation.
One thing OpenText does well is create cool code names. In 2013, OpenText announced Red Oxygen, which introduced a harmonized suite of products: The Content Suite, The Process Suite, The Experience Suite, The Information Exchange Suite, and the Discovery Suite.
Two years later under Project Blue Carbon, those suites are packaged into the overarching OpenText Suite 16 and OpenText Cloud 16. This marks the first time all the products have been updated at the same time ensuring customers can access all the capabilities they need without having to wait for updates from another product.
The OpenText Suite 16 now comprises four on-premises suites: Enterprise Content Management, Business Process Management, Customer Experience Management and Analytics (the analytics capabilities come from the acquisition of Actuate a year ago).
Along with the on-premises suites, OpenText is offering cloud-based versions available within OpenText’s managed cloud or with a third party cloud provider.
OpenText Cloud 16 is made up a managed cloud services, cloud-based offering, and native SaaS solutions.
Addressing digital transformation
The big theme for OpenText this year is a common theme across many enterprises – digital transformation. Lubor Ptacek, OpenText Vice President of Product Marketing, spoke about the challenges enterprises face today. They know they need to transform their businesses, and many have already started with the customer experience. But there’s more to digital transformation than customer experience, and these enterprises are trying to figure out exactly what they need to do and how to do it.
Ptacek outlined OpenText’s five key areas that drive digital transformation:

Better engagement with customers, employees, business partners, suppliers and so on.
Better productivity, whether it’s individual or team productivity, or even extended out to partners and other external parties.
Better innovation – part of which includes social, but Ptacek points out there’s more to think about here such as providing the right insights and business processes.
Better decision making. How do you get better insights and make educated decisions? The shift is moving from a backward-looking process to forward-looking using predictive capabilities.
Better control is a traditional theme for OpenText, and it understands enterprises have regulations, security and privacy concerns to address.

OpenText and the cloud
Ptacek said that many customers are approaching cloud on a project by project or solution by solution basis. Enterprises are in no rush, and many understand that some solutions fit better in the cloud and some on premises. New initiatives are also much easier to start in the cloud compared to moving existing solutions.
The reality is most enterprises are somewhere in between cloud and on-premises, and it varies by industry and also within industries. Ptacek said there is no cookie-cutter solution – it depends on the organization and their needs. He said that five years from now every enterprise will have some hybrid scenario.
As part of OpenText Cloud 16, OpenText is also building a few native Saas-based solutions, such as OpenText Core. Core started as a document management and collaboration offering (similar to Box), but Ptacek told me that OpenText is building out Core in two key ways.
The first is integration with the on-premises information management platform, specifically the Content Suite, and the second is expanding Core to become a platform upon which new solutions are built (this part is future planning).
OpenText has introduced subscription-based pricing for cloud services for all Suites. It also introduced managed cloud services around specific value propositions. Essentially OpenText has bundled a series of software solutions and professional services into special packages.
A few release highlights
There are many updates to each of the four suites within OpenText Suite 16, as well as OpenText Cloud 16 – you can check out the press release for all the details. Here’s a sampling of some key capabilities that support the five areas noted above.

Integration with Salesforce CRM and Success Factors. This is tight integration including users, user groups, workspaces and tasks as well as processes, said Ptacek.
Also regarding productivity, adoption has been addressed through a complete redesign of the user experience, in particular, the Content Suite. This new UX is intuitive and takes advantage of progressive menus and navigation.
Social capabilities have been embedded into the content experience.
With the acquisition of Actuate one year ago, OpenText can now embed analytics into all its suites – the Content Suite, the Process Suite, the Business Network (the B2B supply chain integration), and the Experience Suite (including analytics for media management).
The Process Suite has a new entity modeling layer, using reusable coarse components. The goal is to make building process applications easier for what Ptacek called the citizen developer (the people who know and understand the business processes).
The new OpenText Communication Center provides multi-channel personalized communications ensuring customers can be reached through the communication channels they prefer. The Communications Center is part of the Experience Suite and integrates with the Business Network where it gets capabilities like text messaging.

OpenText Suite 16 is entering beta testing now. Beta testing for the Content Suite is the first one in progress and is where the most innovations have occurred. Both OpenText Suite 16 and OpenText Cloud 16 will be released in March of 2016.
My take
With these releases, OpenText highlights four important elements of digital transformation – business process, user adoption, cloud, and analytics. These are all common themes across all enterprises faced with the challenges of digital disruption (and that’s pretty much everyone) and all vendor software updates. Is any of this ground-breaking? Maybe not. But it’s good to see that OpenText is working hard to stay within the curve.
