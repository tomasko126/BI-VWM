There is very little that needs to be added and no doubt Google will ding us for writing such a short story but heh ho. But…we don’t believe in sparing blushes so just to say that despite the beaming smile captured during the race, Jess told us on back channels that it was one of the hardest things she has ever done and that it took a good few days to recover. Which lends truth to the adage: no pain, no gain.
More seriously, it is all of us that are thankful to Jess for taking on the challenge on behalf of a cause that seeks to combat Cystic Fibrosis through research, clinical care and supporting clinical trials.
For those that don’t know, we were an early signatory to the 1-1-1 philanthropy pledge pioneered by Marc Benioff, CEO Salesforce. One of the good causes we happily donated towards this year was Jessica’s chosen charity.
