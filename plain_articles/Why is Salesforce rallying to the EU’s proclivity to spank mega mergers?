Stuart Lauchlan provides his assessment of the brewing war between Microsoft and Salesforce following Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn. With his deep knowledge of how the EU likes to take pot shots at technology vendors it believes may violate EU competition laws, Lauchlan says:

So how likely is it that the Commission will decide to investigate? Pretty damn likely, I’d imagine. The Eurocrats in Brussels never knowingly turn down an opportunity to get on their high horses about the US tech industry and Microsoft’s a long-standing target of their attentions. 
In addition, the current Commissioner in charge of anti-trust matters, Margrethe Vestager, is very hot on the topic of how data should be managed in the digital economy. While she has yet to comment specifically on the LinkedIn/Microsoft deal, with suspiciously immaculate timing she yesterday told the EDPS-BEUC Conference on Big Data in Brussels that:

Companies need to make sure they don’t use data in a way that stops others competing.

I have no opinion on this element of the discussion but I do have a view on why Salesforce is taking this unusual position.
Salesforce is starved of data
Putting the deal aspect of the Microsoft/LinkedIn acquisition to one side, it is clear that Salesforce wants to ensure that it can get hold of LinkedIn data in the belief that it is an essential element in creating a data rich repository that sales and marketing people can mine. In that context, Salesforce is viewing CRM as the mirror to LinkedIn’s roots in HCM.
Access to the LinkedIn data is especially important to Salesforce because when Salesforce puts Einstein into the open market, it is going to need access to a number of third party data sources. Right now – and I will caveat by saying there is more to come at Dreamforce next week – it appears that the bulk of the data Einstein works upon is internally generated. Check this from Fortune:

“We have tons of data on our accounts, opportunities, communications around email and calendar and interaction data like campaign emails and social data from Social Studio, Community Cloud and Chatter,” said Socher, who was formerly chief executive of MetaMind. “Einstein uses deep learning, machine learning and natural language processing to those rich signals. With that we can surface predictions in the context of the business user.”

That’s fine as far as it goes but Salesforce knows it needs more, indeed much more, for Einstein to be truly valuable. Salesforce has more or less said so when referencing unspecified ‘traditional databases’ and ‘social networks.’ Hence Salesforce ire at the acquisition.
Salesforce clearly believes that Microsoft will shut down access to LinkedIn data. For its part, Microsoft has not said anything of the sort although that’s clearly how Salesforce views statements emanating from Microsoft. It is possible that Salesforce has already spoken to Microsoft and been given a lukewarm response. No one is saying.
Does access to LinkedIn data matter as much as Salesforce is suggesting? Possibly but not as much as Salesforce imagines.
For a start, it is nigh on impossible today to get access to the LinkedIn firehose of data it holds. For our part for example, we have wanted to get behind the number of shares that LinkedIn provides us on our individual stories. We know that LinkedIn is an important B2B research tool because we see the traffic it generates. What we can’t know is who is behind that traffic.
In our case it would be useful to target groups within the LinkedIn network with specific content using our existing machine learning algorithms used for operational delivery. Right now, that’s impossible.
From Salesforce perspective, the whole raison d’être for machine learning is to accelerate not only data ingestion but predictive analysis of  that data tied to sales and marketing actions. It is hungry for external data and LinkedIn provides a solid short cut.
LinkedIn has issues
On the flip side, would Salesforce want what LinkedIn has to offer? The top line answer is ‘yes’ but then making sense of what LinkedIn holds is far from a done deal.
Last week I asked representatives of technology companies that specialize in understanding the social web why (most) don’t support LinkedIn except on a highly superficial and largely useless basis. This blunt answer rings alarm bells:

The LinkedIn API sucks bug time. We can’t relay on the data it gives us and until it does then we won’t include it.

We have seen continuing issues with authentication between LinkedIn and other services – another area of concern. Ad then of course there are all the truly sucky parts of the LinkedIn user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
My take
Salesforce clearly believes it needs LinkedIn data and is firing some early salvos into what could be a messy battlefield. It’s a battle that Salesforce is far from assured of winning.
Microsoft will have a massive clean up operation, even before it is ether forced to or voluntarily decides what to do about access.
Assuming that it provides access, my guess is that Microsoft will adopt the Twitter model of charging an arm and a leg for access. The upside for Salesforce is that it doesn’t have to do that development work. It just has to write checks,
Microsoft might adopt other tactics like pre-releasing to Dynamics customers so they have a head start on the market.
Whatever Microsoft charges will likely be a rounding error on Salesforce books. Then again, the detail surrounding how any vendor includes data from third parties is important to the whole of this story and especially from an IT perspective because of the governance implications.
In the meantime, I’d equally like to know what plans Salesforce has for ingesting other social network data along with sources like Bloomberg data.
What should customers do? The short answer is continue making CRM investments but don’t bet the whole of your CRM technology landscape on one vendor. Consider the data sources that are important and then press Salesforce to discover which of your required data services will be brought on board. LinkedIn data might be part of that equation. If so then plan to keep a close eye on how this story unfolds.
