Lead story – Re-skilling and up-skilling for the AI age – an organizational challenge demanding radical change by Cath Everett

MyPOV: I’ve been debating the extent of the AI skills gap for organizations, and whether layoffs are justified rather than retraining. So it was timely to get this upskilling take from Cath. At a Changeboard Future Talent event in London, Cath quotes Manpower Group:
Currently around 84% of organisations say they plan to re-skill and up-skill their workforce, so at the moment it’s the corporate sector leading the charge. But to succeed, they’ll need to do more than that – to ensure their people can cope with globalisation and technology, they’ll need to build a learning culture.
A continuous learning culture is imperative. But what skills need to be cultivated? Peter Coats says it’s about getting the balance right between behavior, attitude, and technical skills. Flexible problem-solvers, “who are optimistic and don’t worry if things change,” are needed.
I’ve long believed that so-called “intelligent quotient” (IQ) assessments are flawed arbiters of workplace success, with so-called emotional intelligence having equal, if not greater, relevance. Persistence/grit probably trumps both of them. But Manpower’s Jonas Prising says we now need to add a third dimension to IQ and EQ. Cath quotes Prising:
We now need to build the capability to understand if individuals can learn skills as it’s going to become increasingly important. This involves using Learning Quotient (LQ) in a living process and recognising what skills need to be leveraged in an organisation to ensure success.
But a “growth mindset” only takes us so far. Then we have to figure out how to upskill the displaced. That’s where it gets tricky. Whose responsibility is it? Employers, government, educational systems, individuals? Divide it how you like – all four are behind where they need to be. Cath closes with:
While survey after survey indicate that, while Millennials in particular value personal development opportunities highly, they also believe that employers fall very short in meeting their requirements. So it would appear that there is still an awful lot of work to be done.
Diginomica picks – my top three stories on diginomica this week

You want AI with that? McDonald’s latest tech gambit gets highly personal – Speaking of AI, we now turn to the fast food desperados newly-minted AI experts at McDonald’s, fresh off an AI acquisition. Stuart is right: we shouldn’t scoff at McDonald’s digital ROI infusion. So what does AI and fast food look like? It’s the holy grail of personalization of course. Stuart: “In time, the AI capabilities might lead to the menus recognizing particular car license plates and adjust their priority items based upon a customer’s previous selections.”
Vendors aren’t helping us to build agile HR, says Deutsche Telekom exec – Phil continued his Unleash coverage with this provocative use case: “This was not the only presentation at last week’s Unleash event that spoke about moving to more agile HR processes and at the same time criticized the lack of suitable tools coming from the established HR vendors.” Also see: Phil’s Cognita connects its people across schools in three continents.
The shift from science projects to business processes – NVIDIA GTC shows the pulse of AI – Why is NVIDIA relevant to an enterprise audience? Kurt has one big reason: its role in the pervasive AI resurgence.

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. Here’s my three top choices from our vendor coverage:

Adobe Summit 2019 analysis – CX hype is countered by Chegg’s digital turnaround story – Yep, it’s me from Vegas, in a madcap push to pierce the CX hype to see what’s real. Also see my use case: Adobe Summit 2019 – how Avianca Airlines is facing the transformation challenge.
Ultimately Ultimate goes private – what next? The Ultimate Software financial soap opera corporate evolution takes a decisive turn – Brian’s on the case.
Accenture after Pierre – business as usual, with no pause button – Accenture’s digital driving force may have passed on, but Stuart sees no signs of slowdown.

A few more vendor picks, without the quips:

Rootstock takes away one more excuse not to move ERP to the cloud – Phil
Why Sportable Scoreboards moved to cloud ERP, and what they’ve learned about change – Oracle MBX ’19 – Jon
Unit4 snags Intuo for modern talent enablement – Den

Jon’s grab bag – Open source is free – yeah, right! You can’t charm Martin with open source bromides. Open source is free? Yeah, and what if it contains a security flaw, bad code, or a licensed bit you might owe some bottom-feeding paymaster for? A coalition of open source players are building a smart code archive – Martin’s got the hows and the whys. 

Finally, Neil’s been doing some Thinking about thinking – in an AI context, that is. He writes: “The entire effort of AI is a fight against a computer’s rigidity. But there is a trend that AI may be getting closer to actual intelligence. Or is it?” Short answer? No. But hey, we have our hands full anyway, dealing with the ethical/privacy implications of whatever we call AI today.
Best of the rest
 Lead story – Apple launches services strategy; the pundits weigh in – stories by Ray Wang and Ben Thompson

myPOV: I don’t dwell on Apple in hits/misses. Aside from the BYOD impact of iOS devices, not much to say about Apple and enterprise. But as the ambient ubiquitous Ray Wang writes, their new services play is interesting (Event Report: Apple Formally Launches Services Strategy).
With Apple targeting 20 percent of revenues from Apple services by 2020, Wang writes: “The shift from products to services drives the first step of many as Apple embarks on its own digital transformation journey. ”
Yes, these services are all consumer-focused: Apple News+, Apple Arcade., Apple Card, and Apple TV+. But the shift to services implies the internal upheaval and external market rethink we cover often on diginomica. The question is: why now? In Apple’s Services Event – Ben Thompson of Stratechery posits the unavoidable:
The iPhone isn’t going anywhere — Apple is very much not doomed — but it is no longer growing, leaving Apple no choice but to look elsewhere.

But when Cook says, “At Apple, the customer is, and always will be, at the center of everything that we do,” Thompson takes umbrage:
Frankly, with the possible exception of Apple Arcade, it is hard to see this sentiment in yesterday’s announcements; I’m not saying any of these services are customer hostile, but most of them are imitations of what other companies are already doing, the revenues of which Apple wants a cut of.
Thompson doesn’t think this Apple resembles the Steve Jobs “put a ding in the universe” Apple. Hmm – Apple as fast follower?
Other standouts:

Dirty Little Secrets of your System Integrator: Why Companies Still Go Over Budget – For a minute there, I thought UpperEdge’s John Belden was writing the script for a horror movie: “Here are five ways that consultants assure that the client is carrying the risk.” Yikes!
5 Ways To Demystify Zero Trust Security– Louis Columbus is back with another notable piece on getting to zero trust security: “Instead of only relying on security vendors’ claims about Zero Trust, benchmark them on a series of five critical success factors instead, with customer results being key.“


Honorable mention 

The Never Ending Fight Against the “Safe Choice” – Gartner’s Hank Barnes implores us to take the innovation plunge in a world of KPI culture paralysis micro-measurement, by making the business case for strategic risk: “To fight the safe choice, be prepared with examples of the risk of playing it safe. “
Your Business Blueprint Should Dictate Your SAP S/4HANA Implementation – Not the Other Way Around – Not sure if Eric Kimberling was looking for an “Amen” here, but he’s got one. Well said.
Economic Conditions Snapshot, March 2019 – McKinsey’s latest global economic survey paints a bit of a gloomy picture, with trade concerns looming large. A few silver linings are noted.
Riding the K-wave: Disruptive innovation in the age of sustainability – Denis Pombriant, riffing on his latest book release, is loads more optimistic than I am. He writes: “We’re at the beginning of a new economic cycle, a K-wave; one that will offer the greatest industry, job, and wealth generating opportunities in history. If this movie looks familiar it’s because you remember the beginning of the age of IT.” An optimist with data is a worthy foil indeed…

Whiffs
As if I needed any more proof of the end times, the Arizona Cardinals now give their players phone study breaks.
You start to see kind of hands twitching and legs shaking, and you know they need to get that social media fix.
These are grown men, right? Speaking of maturing very gradually:

A couple blockchain enthusiasts objected. I don’t deny there are intersection points, but I’ll put it to you this way: if every live blockchain project blockchain proof of concept is canceled tomorrow, “AI,” ML – and its hype tsunami – would be just fine. I look forward to refining these concepts in my upcoming article:
