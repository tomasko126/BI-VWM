On the occasion of my 1,000th story on diginomica I thought I’d share some of the data I am looking at.
Several things are clear. Our user stories are popular. The snapshot  above, which I took about an hour ago, typifies what we see at times of the day when there isn’t much fresh content competing for attention.
That’s usually in the early evening Pacific Time through to about 7am London time and over the weekends. The snapshot comes from a system we use to discover what is being read at any one time and is ranked according to the number of concurrent readers interacting with the content in real time. When we see something that is getting a lot of attention, we can remind our external network of contacts that the story is proving of interest, thus ensuring that the story’s current ‘life’ continues.
As you can see, there is a wide range of interest among readers that goes back in time with the earliest story dating from April, 2015. That tells me there is interest across many of the topics we cover.
I get the sense that these stories are being read as background content for things that our readers are doing elsewhere. The reason I say that is because apart from a few instances, we don’t see these stories being socially shared as much as industry or stories providing a degree of topic analysis. At least that’s what the search data I’ve been poring over seems to suggest. It would be nice to see the stories being shared more but that’s not something we can easily influence.
I have long argued that people sell to people, regardless of what pundits or vendor marketers have to say so the fact that ‘old’ content is still commanding attention speaks not only to the popularity of the content, but also where buyers are at in their decision making process.
Just under 10% of our stories are in the ‘use case’ category and I’d like to see us put out many more so if you know of a good one, then ping me: den [at] diginomica [dot] com and we’ll get the right person to pick it/them up.
As a tip, we like to occasionally run multiple stories in a sequence. That helps buyers get different angles on a similar topic, so if you have say three good ones then don’t be shy about letting us take them on.
You might notice that I have not been especially assertive in my assessment of what the data is saying. That’s because we use a clutch of tools that all claim to come from the same starting point but which don’t agree on common metrics like pages viewed.
This is a bit of a mystery but it suggests to me that the state of the art in web analytics is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the level of ‘error’ is well within statistically acceptable margins for me to be only mildly irritated.
