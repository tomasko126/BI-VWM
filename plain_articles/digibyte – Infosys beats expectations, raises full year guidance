Hot on the heels of TCS’s rather flat numbers earlier in the week, rival Infosys has followed up with rather more impressive numbers, boasting a 6.6% year-year-on-year increase in net profits, topping out at Rs34.7 billion ($515 million) on revenues of Rs159 billion.

That beat analyst expectations and allowed CEO Vishal Sikka to raise full year revenue growth projections to between 8.9% and 9.3%, up from earlier guidance of between 6.4% and 8.4%. He said:

The overall climate looks good. We are comfortable with what our Q4 looks like and it will set us up with a nice ability to execute the year ahead of us. We have earlier said we are confident of industry-leading growth in next financial year. We are on track for that.

The company added four clients in the $25 million and above category in the third quarter with Infosys President B Pravin Rao confident of more to come:
There were three deals that we couldn’t close in the quarter because of holiday season, we have already converted two of them. We see a deal pipeline of $3 billion.
We’ll have a deeper dive on this later.
Disclosure – at time of writing, Infosys is a premier partner of diginomica.
