Jon and Den were in the same place at the same time. This doesn’t happen often. We decided to video our thoughts on a few topics that cropped up during the week. This is our digital dump and runs about 13 minutes.
Jon was at an independently run SAP Controlling event. He talks about the top of mind analytics issues in which that audience is interested.
Den talked about his conversation with a behavioral scientist from Infor. That dovetailed to topics around bias in the hiring process and Jon’s Facebook foray.
For the week ahead, Den will be at Workday Rising while Jon prepares for a deep dive with Couchbase. Jon plans to write up a conversation with the CEO of Visier which promises to be spicy.
Finally, we found an easy dog of the week in the VW Dieselgate story. Jon talks about programming ethics.
We quite like this format and think it could form the basis of a weekly show. It’s likely we’ll have to record it either as a Skype or Hangout gig when we’re on different sides of the US but that should be OK. We’re also offering the show as a short podcast for those who prefer that method of content consumption.
What do you think? Something worthwhile?

Disclosure: SAP, Workday and Infor are premier partners at time of writing.
