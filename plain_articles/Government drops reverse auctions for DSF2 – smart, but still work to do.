This means that the Government Digital Service (GDS) and the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) have deemed it legally sound to make changes to the Invitation to Tender – something that we had previously thought would be tricky to do.
However, kudos should go to the teams for making it work, as this was one of the strongest complaints against the framework, as a community of suppliers involved in the bidding process argued that it reduced their services and organisations to cheap “body-shops”.
But its important to remember that whilst this is a very strong step in the right direction, there are still a number of other changes that need to be addressed ahead of the next iteration of DSF.
By way of background, DSF2, and its predecessor, were intended to provide the government with a list of suppliers that could give it the skills it needed to design and build customised digital services. Whilst the G-Cloud is intended to provide commodity, off-the-shelf digital products, DSF was intended to provide complementary agile design and build services.
However, we at diginomica suspected that all was not right following the launch of the first DSF, given that the government was reluctant to release any figures on how much spend had passed through the framework. Following a Freedom of Information request, we revealed in May last year that up until that point  just over £2m had been bought using DSF, which paled in comparison to the flourishing G-Cloud.
With the government aware that the framework had its faults, but recognising a need for these skills, hopes were high for a new and improved DSF2. But those hopes were short-lived. Following the release of the Invitation to Tender documents, which invites suppliers to bid for a place on the framework, and which details the terms and conditions of being listed, a number of suppliers spoke out about how DSF2 was still going to be an ineffective tool for Whitehall.

Harry Metcalfe, MD at design agency dxw, wrote a detailed blog outlining his criticisms of the second iteration and spearheaded a campaign for change with other suppliers and the media – knowingly using the hashtag on Twitter #gcloudforever (a nod to the success of the design of that framework).
Metcalfe told me at the time:

We need to build on the shining example of the G-Cloud framework, using short contracts, open standards, flexible terms and financial transparency to manage cost and commercial risk. Heavy-handed procurement process should be a thing of the past.
We need to abandon DSF, reinstate development in G-Cloud, and get on with delivering.

Following a week of controversy surrounding the complaints, G-Cloud director Tony Singleton put his hands up and admitted that GDS/CCS hadn’t a done good enough job and would aim to overhaul the framework for its next iteration and work with the community to make sure it got it right for DSF3. In an exclusive interview with diginomica, Singleton said:

DSF3 was always going to be the revolution, the complete revamp of the entire thing. I wouldn’t want to say we are going to tear it up, but that’s actually what we are going to do. Go right back to basics and ask: what is the problem we are trying to solve? It’s about providing capability and teams to people trying to transform services and do bespoke builds.
It’s really a matter of listening to everyone. We are talking to digital leaders, tech leaders across government to get their input. I am committed to blogging regularly about what we are doing; so everyone knows what’s coming out of discovery, where we are thinking about going and so on. What I don’t want to do is get to the end of the two months discovery, publish something, and then everyone says no that’s wrong.

And since then I haven’t paid too much attention to DSF, as I thought we would be waiting for the third iteration to proceed before any further interesting updates. That was until I saw a tweet yesterday from the Digital Marketplace team, which is responsible for DSF. They tweeted:

The decision has been taken not to carry out the reverse auction for Digital Services 2. Suppliers should have received an email.

I am being forwarded the letter by one of the suppliers today, I will update with any additional information as and when I get it.
The reverse auction was one of the most controversial elements of DSF and the fact that the government
The man in charge of G-Cloud and DSF, Tony Singleton
teams involved have taken the risk and worked with their legal teams to strip it out at this stage, as opposed to just waiting for the third iteration process to begin, shows the sort of resolve that we often wish we saw from Whitehall technology procurement teams. They’ve listened to feedback and iterated in direct response, despite the strict procurement controls that are bound to be in place.
I can’t recall an example of when this has happened before.
The problem with the reverse auction was that it meant that once suppliers submitted their bids, only the cheapest ones were chosen. Given that digital design and build skills aren’t a commodity and shouldn’t be reduced to the cheapest price going, this not only potentially stripped government departments of the best skills on the market, but disillusioned some suppliers, as they felt undervalued.
And let’s face it – digital skills are highly sought after in today’s market, especially in the UK. Why would suppliers waste time and money bidding for a government contract, if they were going to be knocked out for being too expensive, when they could go and sell their services at their set price to private buyers elsewhere?
I asked the Cabinet Office for a statement on this, but was told that more information would be made available soon. I’ve also been told that GDS will be blogging on the matter next week to reveal what it has been up to during the quiet period over the election.
However, as we can see from the reaction on Twitter, the news was well received:

@GOVUKdigimkt sense has prevailed

@GOVUKdigimkt @SMECrownRep great! Thanks for being so open and responsive to feedback. Nice work!

Digital Services e-Auctions ditched! Jolly good news #gcloudforever
— Harry Metcalfe (@harrym) May 26, 2015

Again, it’s just worth noting that this is the sort of approach to procurement that Whitehall needs to adopt more frequently. Yes, it can’t do anything that’s illegal, but it also shouldn’t be afraid to do things that are both beneficial to suppliers and its buyers.

But, we also shouldn’t take this news as ‘job done’ on the Digital Services Framework – there is still plenty to do. Whilst the removal of the reverse auction goes some way to improving the process for selecting suppliers and helping to ensure that the best quality are available on the framework, it doesn’t actually address the restructuring needs of DSF. I’m sure these are being considered as part of the third iteration of the framework, and I know Tony Singleton gets this, but it’s worth highlighting some of the changes that still need to occur.
Harry Metcalfe also welcomed the changes to DSF2, but pointed out that it is the next iteration to the framework that will be great. He said:






This is very welcome news. The auction is a long-standing problem and was one of the worst features of this framework, so it’s great to see it go. I don’t think this will be enough to rescue DS2 but work is already underway on DS3 and I’m confident it’ll be a great improvement.






The main point to address here is how DSF is structured in terms of its lots – the capabilities that buyers can select from. Harry Metcalfe explained to me at the time of his blog that one of the biggest problems of the framework was how it split lots into developers, designers, user researchers and delivery managers. Whilst this might seem sensible, what that means as a result is that buyers were simply given the option to cherry-pick certain skills, as opposed to choosing an agency as a full capability that could work with a department on completing a project. Metcalfe said to me at the time:

But that’s not the way DSF works. On DSF, you might win one lot in a project and no others. Developers, but no designers. It’s a way to buy people, not projects. The framework is essentially a mechanism for body-shopping, which is just not workable for most suppliers.
A good company is more than the sum total of its staff’s Linkedin profiles. As big a part of the quality and effectiveness of a company as its individuals are its culture and its shared experience. Its collective sense of purpose and mission, and its corporate memory. And the effectiveness of its teams, based on their trust, friendship, mutual respect and understanding. In dxw’s experience, clients value these things as much as they value our technical expertise.

This approach to buying is very different from technology buying of the past in the public sector. Previously buying in Whitehall  been about working with a bunch of consultants and the biggest suppliers in the market. Everything was kind of done at arms-length. But DSF is also an opportunity for internal Whitehall teams to learn and work with some of the most creative digital agencies in the UK – something that will hopefully be embraced. But by reducing the lots to skills that are needed to ‘fill gaps’, undermines that opportunity.
My take
A very smart move from GDS and CCS – the decision will be welcomed and it shows strength in their ability to listen to feedback and make changes. A good sign that egos aren’t getting in the way!
However, it will be interesting to see what structural changes will be made to DSF3 off the back of the supplier feedback. We will keep you posted as and when we get more information.
