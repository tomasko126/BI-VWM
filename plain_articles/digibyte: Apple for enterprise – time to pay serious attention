While I’ve been buried in Workday briefings at the company’s annual Rising conference, Time Cook, Apple CEO took the stage at Boxworks with Aaron Levie, Box CEO. During that session, Cook said that sales to enterprise in the year to June 30th 2015 topped $25 billion. That’s a big number. It’s bigger than SAP’s annual revenue, even though it only represents 14 percent of Apple’s total revenue. If that wasn’t enough, Cook went on to say that:
This is not a hobby, this is a real business.
Adding to the conversation:
Pointing toward Microsoft’s Office demo at Apple’s media event earlier this month, Cook notes “Apple and Microsoft can partner on more things than we can compete on. And that’s what the customer wants. […] I’m not a believer in holding grudges.”
Last year, Apple announced a partnership with IBM that will lead to:

a new class of more than 100 industry-specific enterprise solutions including native apps, developed exclusively from the ground up, for iPhone and iPad;
unique IBM cloud services optimized for iOS, including device management, security, analytics and mobile integration;
new AppleCare® service and support offering tailored to the needs of the enterprise;  and
new packaged offerings from IBM for device activation, supply and management.

At Rising, demonstrations routinely switched between iPad and iPhone with only a nod in the direction of Android devices. In addition, Aneel Bhsuri, CEO Workday mentioned Office 365 as one of the applications where ‘he lives’ on his iPad. At the Workday event, most of the staff I met were toting MacBook Air with nary a PC laptop in sight.
If you believe that cloud services of the kind Box and Workday sells are the future then based upon what we heard today, Apple could end up the hardware supplier of choice. That of course is a long ways off…
Disclosure: Workday and SAP are premier partners at time of writing
