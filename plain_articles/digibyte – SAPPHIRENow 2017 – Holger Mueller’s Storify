Holger Mueller, principal at Constellation Research records his impression of technology events in a specific way using Storify. This is a collection of Tweets that capture the mood and essence of a presentation for wider consumption as seen through his eyes. It is an interesting way to collect and disseminate information.
With his permission, we show how Mueller saw the McDermott/Leukert keynote at SAPPHIRENow. There are some great nuggets to be found as you sift through the content he captured.
Enjoy
