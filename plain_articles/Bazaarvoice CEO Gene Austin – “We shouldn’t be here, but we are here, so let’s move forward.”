Gene Austin
It’s been over a year since social shopping tools company Bazaarvoice was ordered by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to divest the PowerReviews business that it acquired back in 2012, on the grounds that the deal broke antitrust rules.
While Bazaarvoice finally settled the case with the DOJ in April 2014, it’s clear that CEO Gene Austin still struggles with the ruling. [The PowerReviews deal, it’s important to note, predates his November 2013 arrival at the company]. He tells me:
I joined [Bazaarvoice] just as we were ramping up the lawsuit. I just couldn’t imagine a $15 million company that we acquired being looked at by the US government as anti-competitive. I just couldn’t fathom it.
Today, I fully respect and will adhere to the settlement that was agreed between Bazaarvoice and the DOJ, because it’s in the best interests of the company, our shareholders and our employees to do so.
But I don’t agree with the situation at all. I don’t understand it. I think there were lots of problems with the case. Prior leadership made mistakes in the way they handled the acquisition… but those mistakes don’t overshadow what I still believe was a decision that’s hard to understand.
The settlement has had a number of negative impacts on Bazaarvoice. One stipulation of that settlement – along with the divestiture – is that Bazaarvoice is now obliged to allow its customers to switch to PowerReviews, without penalty, until July 2015. A “very small number” have defected, says Austin, but he won’t disclose the numbers until the company’s 4Q2015 earnings call on 10 June.
Either way, he’s now intent on driving the company onwards, he says:
It’s unfortunate. We shouldn’t be here – but we are here, so let’s move forward.
Seeking growth
With sales growth slowing for Bazaarvoice’s core ratings and review product Conversations, Austin sees new add-on products being the company’s best chance to create “new growth engines” in coming years [see yesterday’s story for more on these]. These tools aim to help retailers and brand get more and better use from what Austin calls customer-generated content, or CGC, by introducing analytic and search-engine optimisation (SEO) capabilities, for example, on top of Conversations.
So what’s driving these innovations – customer demand or the need to set out a positive vision for Bazaarvoice? Austin says:
I think it’s definitely a healthy combination of the two. We’re certainly seeing our customers use more customer-generated photos and video content on top of traditional reviews and ratings content. There’s clear customer-pull there, which is why we launched our Curations product at last year’s Bazaarvoice Summit:
But what we’re pushing customers on is the notion that CGC is meaningful in many, many different areas than just online. Because it’s the most trusted content out there, you need to use it and repurpose it elsewhere.
Dutch electronics giant Philips, for example, now prints CGC collected on its consumer-products packaging, for example. UK insurance company Aviva is using it in broadcast and print advertising.
In terms of revenue, Bazaarvoice’s main sales come from the annual SaaS subscriptions paid to it by retailers and brands. These fees also include moderation of reviews, carried out by a vast army of freelance home-workers, often stay-at-home mums and retired people. Their services cost the company around $3 million per year, or around 2% of overall revenues.

But Austin’s also looking to generate more sales from professional services around consulting and implementation, an area that he willingly concedes the company was failing to monetise, prior to his arrival. In fact, it seems, there has been much that Austin has felt the need to ‘put right’ at Bazaarvoice in his 18 months there:
I was attracted to the opportunity because I could tell this was a SaaS company that wasn’t operating as it should. I felt I could impact change in a positive way here… The most important aspect for me was that I didn’t feel like the company was as customer-centric as it could have been, which is why, in my keynote yesterday, my final remarks were around making our customers more successful and being a better partner to them.
I felt like we were very focused on growing the company but not necessarily growing it the right way, growing with our customers. One of the things about a SaaS business is that in the early years, when you’re young and you’re small, acquiring customers is the lifeblood of the company. But when you get to be ten years old, holding on to customers is as important as adding new ones. And we hadn’t successfully moved into that model.
And there is still plenty of work to do, he says:
We have a lot of room for improvement – no question. Our growth rate now is high single digits and we should really be doing double that. But we’re putting the right things in place to get us there. We’ve unleashed our innovation team and customers are starting to see that.
