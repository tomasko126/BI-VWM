Please join us in officially welcoming ServiceNow as the latest enterprise software vendor to become a diginomica premier partner.
I’ve personally been following ServiceNow for a number of years now, and its progress to become one of the leading cloud companies in the enterprise buyer’s market has been quite remarkable.
Over a short period ServiceNow has grown from being a cloud provider of IT service management software, to a platform that can now effectively ‘servitize’ the entire organisation.
Enterprises the world over waste too much time and money on carrying out tasks manually, which could be streamlined and automated. In fact, McKinsey researchers recently calculated that 49 percent of time spent on work activities could be automated, driving greater productivity gains.
This is ServiceNow’s sweet spot. It’s ability to create services across the enterprise that not only make the work itself easier, meaning more time spent focusing on important tasks, but also stripping out unnecessary costs.
The company itself has also had to adapt as this idea of ‘servitization’ has taken hold of enterprise buyers. As ServiceNow expanded its reach outside of the IT department, becoming the backbone for how many departments and companies operate, it has had to learn quickly how to communicate at a strategic level with those sitting right at the top of the enterprise.
The future of the ServiceNow platform also looks to be interesting, with the company making recent investments in machine learning technologies, so as to make work processes more ‘intelligent’. These aren’t just buzzwords in this example. ServiceNow is in an excellent position, and has an excellent use case, to take advantage of machine learning and AI capabilities.
So, welcome ServiceNow – we are delighted to have you joining us at diginomica. Take a read of ServiceNow’s first diginomica partner contribution now, which has some very interesting thoughts on the future of work.
