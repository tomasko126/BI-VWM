I met Phil Libin, recently resigned CEO Evernote in Paris at LeWeb – I think it was 2010 or 2011. At the time, I asked Libin if he thought Evernote had the potential for making a strong enterprise play. He scoffed at the idea, convinced that the then nascent note taking, synch and search solution could continue happily as a quasi consumer offering. I walked away from that meeting scratching my head because it seemed crazy that a company that was meeting such an obvious need did not see the opportunity.
Fast forward to today and we find that after two months in post, Chris O’Neill, Libin’s replacement, is hacking back staff by 13 percent with 47 announced redundancies and the closure of three offices: Moscow, Singapore and Taiwan. Evernote keeps its Chinese operation, which, with 11.5 million users, represents Evernote’s second largest market. O’Neill also flagged the shuttering of peripheral services like Evernote Food, the recipe clipper. Even so, one has to wonder what’s going on and whether we should caution the continued use of what has been an invaluable service.
Reports suggest that Evernote is at least cashflow positive and does not need capital. However, a scathing analysis by Josh Dickson earlier in the month suggests that Evernote is adrift with little future:
It’s core product remains too useful for free to encourage anyone but power users, of which there are becoming fewer, to upgrade. And it’s hard to see how Evernote will have success in selling into corporations after it never built out a sales force or enterprise-focused product offerings.
That seems harsh to me but I understand why Dickson arrives at his conclusion. All the same, myself, along with colleagues who pay for the service are more than happy to continue using it. Our hope must be that having cleared the decks, O’Neill addresses the need to make Evernote a compelling offering. It will be a tough road ahead.
