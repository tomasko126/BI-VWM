diginomica hit: Internet of Things, collaboration and HR use case spotlight – with Phil, Jessica, and Janine
quotage: “As my diginomica colleague Derek Du Preez is fond of saying, there’s no point in pursuing an Internet of Things strategy unless you’re also developing a service-centric mindset rather than one that’s product-focused. Schneider Electric certainly understands the need to transform to as-a-service business models.” – Phil
myPOV: Each week customer use cases are a key part of diginomica’s editorial agenda. Our use case queen Jessica Twentyman shared the story of Faber & Faber’s collaboration journey in Faber & Faber turns the page on document storage and collaboration. (Good insights on assessing cloud collaboration options). In Holding out for a ‘shero’, our resident HR maven looks at how Hunkemöller International turned to video and social tools in a push to make their employees experience as dynamic as a “shero,” their target 28-year-old female customer.
In Designing tomorrow’s connected products at Schneider Electric, Phil looks at how energy management behemoth Schneider Electric is getting its IoT and connected products strategy lined up. What’s interesting in this business-led approach is how the IoT is conceived as a services play. One nifty takeaway: data from machines in the field can, in turn, impact product design.
diginomica five: my completely subjective top five stories on diginomica this week

 Will 2016 give birth to a bold new world of work? – Charlie returns with a look ahead to what he sees as a year of trend convergence. What does that mean? He contrasts an “increased focus on meaningful and enjoyable work” with the emergence of automated virtual assistants, and jobs that will be “automated out of existence.”
UK gov’s data chief says he needs more data scientists and he needs them quickly – Paul Maltby is now the director of data at GDS in the UK. Lucky him – as Derek reports, he’s inherited a ‘big data dilemma’. Sidenote: Kudos to Maltby for not idealizing data science unicorns and acknowledging that in-house analysts can be upskilled – “it’s about curiosity and having the right tools”. Can I hear an “Amen?”
Barnes & Noble’s omni-channel pitch makes for uncomfortable reading – For those who worship at the altar of digital, Barnes & Noble is a good reminder that for every digital winner (Amazon), there will be losers – or, if not losers, difficult journeys. Stuart applies his retail savvy to Barnes & Noble’s mad quest for the omni-channel.
Dueling rants: Stuart on IT spending fails, Den on Black Friday e-commerce absurdity – Two rants-with-a-purpose for your perusal. Nothing gets in Stuart’s craw like IT overspending in the public sector, and when it threatens UK national security, that’s injury to insult. He’s got a doozy for ya in The billion pound IT fiasco that undermines national security. Den, meanwhile, takes issue with pundits who point to Black Friday success by-the-numbers. He sees a fail in the e-commerce assault – check it out in The utterly undifferentiated machine gun approach to consumer advertising (I’m betting he was unsubscribing like a madman, I know I was).

Vendor analysis, diginomica style – HPE Discover held its European conference debut in London last week, and Stuart was on hand to fry the griddle cakes (give me “griddle cakes” over “hot takes” any day). Stuart filed two pieces: HPE Discover – Microsoft and HPE’s ‘friends with benefits’ open relationship and HPE Discover – when John Manzoni came to praise, not bury, the oligopoly? Given that Hewlett-Packard split in two last month, this first-ever public HPE event was a so-called “historic gathering.” But Stuart found more evidence of customer assurances than seismic shifts: “the clear underlying message to customers was one of continuity and safe pair of hands.”
Fresh off a jaunt to his favorite American city, Las Vegas, Den pulled insights from the AppDynamics show. In AppDynamics – the digital transformation champion?, he ponders whether AppDynamics can become a key enabler for digital transformation in the large scale enterprise. Den pursued the digital transformation theme in a sit down with new AppDynamics CEO David Wadhwani.
At RedMonk’s ThingMonk event, Derek picked up on a catch IBM talk, IBM’s seven deadly sins for IoT design (I’m partial to “Gluttony,” or in IoT terms, the need to “recognize the difference between what’s needed and what’s capable.” Meantime, Martin reflects on Microsoft’s CRM moves in Microsoft Convergence – eyeballing a new battleground for CRM user engagement. Gist: “When it comes to CRM and ERP, Microsoft has done OK, but not been brilliant. This could mark the start of a fight back by being faster off the mark.”
Stuart parses Box’s earnings in Box looks to Platform and Governance to fuel growth (Wall Street was underwhelmed, but Box has some platform tricks up its sleeve). Phil examines the state of identity as a cloud service in Ping enlists Google to spin the steel thread of identity. (Sidenote: interesting views on controlling security by controlling identity.) Phil’s also got the Workday-ADP skinny: Workday allies with ADP payroll to extend global reach. Den wraps our vendor coverage with Sage Software’s somewhat confusing transition to a subscription business model.

Jon’s grab bag – Another week, another banking report on jobs and robotics. Derek’s got this one: Barclays claims robotics and automation will “safeguard” manufacturing jobs. The jobs data in the report is nuanced; Derek is right to assert that even if job levels aren’t decimated, the nature of the skills needed will absolutely change. Ergo: don’t relax into a robot. And in Cloud contracts – why having lots may be misguided, Martin looks at data from 451 Research which notes that negotiating individual, long-term contracts for services and applications is cheaper than a single contract with a CSP. Your teaser from Martin: “It may be true, but it is arguably not such good advice.”
Best of the rest
 Making sense of Oracle, SAP and HP – if you dare, by three smart folks
quotage: “[Oracle] is a company that is beginning to move the ship in the direction it has to go. The rate of movement is different in different parts of the company – the mission of the company is getting clearer with their cloud-focused message – the technologies that they are developing have some that are excellent and in some cases likely to be market leading. But they still need to beat the poor public image they have as a company that does whatever it wants and says whatever it wants and they need to end the skewed positioning they keep promoting.” – Paul Greenberg
myPOV: We had to wait a long-ass time while for Paul Greenberg’s epic review of Oracle OpenWorld but it was still piping hot when it came out of the oven. I won’t add much more to my analysis as Greenberg’s quote takes a provocative stance. But in his epic post you will get some smart stuff on Oracle’s messaging – what Greenberg thinks it should be versus what it is. In the piece, Greenberg adds that Oracle is the one company that can say “We provide you with the technology you need (software and hardware) to enable your enterprise value chain.” But – his critique stands. And yes, he did grade the food as per usual. 🙂
Meantime, SAP fanatics addicts watchers have been wondering Whatever Happened to SAP Simple Logistics? Well, Kevin Reilly has the answer on ASUGnews.com. The answer’s pretty annoying simple: SAP changed the name, as part of a purge of the “simple” monicker. It’s now called S/4HANA Enterprise Management, and yeah, it’s still simple in spirit, though complex enough to handle your global logistics requirements. Jeez I could have had a career in software marketing….
Then there’s HP earnings, which is at least interesting to talk about after the split. In Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. Results Go in Opposite Directions, Re/code’s Arik Hesseldahl has quotage from Whitman and a review of the two company’s financials, which are veering in different directions. Whitman actually says, and I quote, “The wisdom behind the split is becoming apparent. You can already start to feel it.” Well, I feel the numbers, and they are a tale of two companies. We shall see…
Other standouts

Humans and machines gettin’ along! – In Jeff Nolan’s Dawn of the Emotional Machine, he reflects on the human-robot emotional relationship and says… it is possible: “To answer Lisa Padilla’s question: yes, I believe we will form emotional bonds with robots.” I’m not a robot optimist, but I see a similar bright side. I believe the next generation of machines were are nudging up against now will make a dent in human loneliness. And: there is a commercial market to be had there too. Ron Miller of TechCrunch takes a big data angle, arguing that Big Data Still Requires Humans To Make Meaningful Connections.

Honorable mention

Developing a Methodology for Analyzing Open Source Communities – A stake in the ground is a good thing indeed.
Ballmer: Microsoft’s cloud revenue numbers are “bullshit” – Not sure this is a big news story, but… #ensw news headline of the week shoe-in, right?
An Encryption ‘Backdoor’ Is a Bad Idea – Good one. I’m riffing on this and some other encryption fodder Tuesday…
3 hottest cloud job skills for 2016 – Overly concise, and yes there is such a thing. But: spot on.
Whiffs
So AT&T says it shelved a “bunch” of ideas because of net neutrality rules. Don’t know about you, but I’m all broken up inside. It’s not just my love of the AT & T brand, it’s knowing the world will be forever deprived of this ideation exercise. Speaking of which, has any company ever done a worse job of deprecating/exiting a product and leaving a bread crumb trail of massive security vulnerabilities than Adobe Flash? (213 registered vulnerabilities in 2015 alone!).
Speaking of vulnerabilities, Buzzfeed published a way to check on Facebook’s bizarre collection of your ad preferences by keyword. And you can get rid of them too, as long as you are willing to delete them one by one. I never knew big brother would be so user friendly!
OK. I’ve picked on this writer before, so maybe it’s getting personal, but You’re Probably Not Rich Enough to Opt Out of the Internet is, well, a wet noodle entry in the tech ethics conversation. First off – “Rich” has nothing to do with opting out of the Internet. I’ve met people living in the Everglade swamp. They didn’t have a phone much less Siri. But they knew how to hunt. In short, they had fortitude. So the proper article title here is “You don’t have the balls/ovaries to opt-out of the Internet.” And for most of us, myself included, that’s true.
As for this: “I’m not knocking the ‘net. It has made my personal life immeasurably better. Shortly, I’ll get off a plane, and by the time I hit the concourse, I will have arranged my transportation home and for dinner to be waiting. I’ll have ensured my dog is walked, and informed my editor he should publish this piece. That will take a dozen clicks on four apps.”
You know what would make my personal life immeasurably better? Having a wonderful, nuanced conversation with someone while they weren’t compulsively checking their phone, pressing buttons on apps, and thinking to themselves about how great the ‘net is. Here’s a truly wacky idea: walk your own dog. Or: pick up a guitar perhaps. Where’s Jimi Hendrix when we need him most? And please don’t say he’s on the ‘net… See you next time.
