Delta Air Lines is currently experiencing the negative effect unplanned systems downtime can have on customer relations. Following a global computer outage, all scheduled flights have been delayed and customers are currently facing hours stranded at airports and on runways.
Whilst safety is obviously paramount, Delta confirmed that it is having severe technical issues this morning and later confirmed to customers that it was the result of a network outage.
The company tweeted:

Customers should check the status of their flight before heading to the airport while the issue is being addressed.

Customers from all over the world took to Twitter to vent their frustrations, as they look at waits that are likely to last for hours.

Ugh.. stuck in LAX cuz @Delta‘s “system” is down. As if it wasn’t bad enough traveling for 12 hours with a 3yr and a 6yr old, now this 😣😣

It’s sort of sad that after 250k miles in 3 years, it might be time to stop flying @Delta. All flights delayed, no info.

at gate at NRT for 2hrs+. When can we deplane?? Will you pay for alternative flights if I rebook on another carrier? @Delta

And as one Twitter user pointed out:

Wherever you are it’s better than in the #Delta IT department right now

My take
Safety first, of course, but no one enjoys extensive flight delays. Delta is in for a rough few days as it recovers from this. We’ve highlighted before that Delta has a chequered past when it comes to customer service – I’m not sure things will improve much after this week.
Good luck to all those affected.
