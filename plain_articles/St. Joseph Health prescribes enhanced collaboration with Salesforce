We were at a stage in the company where people want to collaborate. We had offices across two states and people who didn’t know any of their colleagues between hospitals.
That’s was the situation a year ago at St. Joseph Health, according to David Baker, vice president of IT. St. Joseph is a healthcare provider with 25,000 employees working across 18 acute care hospitals or providing ambulance services across California and west Texas.
Baker was keen for the organization to apply the benefits of the consumer social and mobile revolution internally, helping to bring together its dispersed workforce and to collaborate and share ideas more easily.
An added impetus for change was that its Microsoft SharePoint licence was coming up for renewal. Taking a close look at how it was being used, Baker found that it was being used as little more than “a glorified file repository”. Only 2,000 out of the 25,000 employees were using it to any extent and of those only four or five could be described as “power users”. Baker explains:
It felt very 1985. It was an old-style intranet with very static content and where people would go for basic information.
There was also an over-reliance on email. This meant, for example, that all the details of a project would be buried in email. If that project manager left the organization, all that knowledge would be lost and the new project manager would have to start over.
Baker was convinced that that the licence fee could be made to work harder with better results. which was where Salesforce entered the picture. Using Salesforce Chatter, the hospital could redevelop its intranet to not only make this information more accessible, but also improve collaboration across the organization.
Softly softly
Rather than go for a big launch and force people to use Chatter, which has been rebranded internally as StaffHub, Baker began with a small 50-user pilot in June 2014. The platform was just put out there and people could use it or ignore it as they wanted.
The softly-softly approach worked well. Within a month, the 50-user pilot had mushroomed to 2,000 users, simply through word of mouth.
This organic growth among users was backed by an elaborate internal communications plan with the aim of helping employees see the benefits of Staffhub and not see it as another IT project foisted upon them. Baker ensured that senior people in the company were totally on-board with the new platform and, just as importantly, he wanted to ensure they were also active participants.
He requested that they post a profile and picture of themselves and to aim to post a message once a week on anything of interest to the business, reasoning that:
People want to see what their leaders and managers are doing.
Senior managers quickly realised that this was a great way of communicating and building bridges with staff and team members they might not come into contact on an everyday basis.
St Joseph Health
Current content includes a rich knowledge base of information, where uses can go to solve technical issues, as well as all the relevant compliance and HR documents they need.
But it’s more than knowledge repository. There are lots of groups, enabling people across departments to collaborate in ways that simply weren’t possible before.
When a project begins, for example, the relevant people join that group and all information and communications are carried out there.
Alongside the new ways of collaborating, Baker’s team also ported the legacy SharePoint data into Chatter, so that there was some continuity of information.
StaffHub is not exclusively a work tool. People use it for personal stuff too, such as posting photos or business trips. People have the choice about which groups and type of posts they receive and can block out stuff that isn’t relevant to them.
It has also begun to reduce the reliance on email as the work communication tool, believes Baker. although he adds:
Email won’t die, but it will be utilised differently.
Version 2
Baker points out that the organization is now used to the basics of StaffHub and ready to add on extra features:
We’re past the newborn stage and into the teenage years. We’ve gone as far as we can with the basic product and think that people want more.
Staff have been able to make suggestions and ideas for improvements on StaffHub using the site, and a lot of the issues raised have been fed into the design of StaffHub version 2.
Baker notes thatversion 2 is a “natural evolution of the product”, and will give individual hospitals the chance to move away from the standard look and feel of Chatter and personalize their landing pages, including local information, video and feeds. The aim with this and everything Baker’s team do is to make StaffHub “as sticky as possible”.
In June, St Joseph’s goes live with Salesforce’s Service Cloud which will improve the way technical problems are dealt with, by improving communication and creating more opportunities for staff to find the answer they need using self-service. As Baker points out:
The business of IT has changed so we want to make IT personal.
Currently, when a doctor calls the IT service desk, it raises a ticket and an engineer heads off to the doctor to sort out a problem. The problem with this is that the doctor and engineer can play tag for a few days as the engineer tries to catch the doctor between patients.
Now, a ticket can be raised immediately but often the answer is available online in the knowledge base or as people in the community step into answer the query.
Baker is pleased with the way the project has gone so far:
We’re only a year in but we’ve delivered the first part really well and new will upgraded the look and feel and be more feature rich and tie in Service Cloud.
In terms of payback, the operational costs are probably lower than with SharePoint, says Baker, but the real ROI is in terms of the satisfaction levels of users and greater engagement.
In terms of soft benefits, there’s far more collaboration, although Baker says that this is mainly concentrated between admin rather than medical personnel. Simple things, like posting the canteen lunch menu on the intranet, are very popular with people.
Today, 23,000 of the 25,000 employees are StaffHub users and it’s become the default “go to” landing page for staff. It is beginning to bring people together into communities, as Baker explains:
It’s absolutely breaking down geographical boundaries.
