VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger attracted some headlines this month with his views on the need for God and more churches in Silicon Valley. But he was firmly back in day job mode yesterday to announce a solid set of first quarter numbers.
Profits for the quarter were $196 million on revenue of $1.51 billion, up 11% year-on-year.
Analyst firm Technology Business Research called the quarter:
a tipping point between its more traditional virtualization business and its future-looking, high-growth hybrid cloud portfolio.
The dynamics of VMware’s business are changing, with approximately 45% of the vendor’s total billings attributed to its compute business (standalone vSphere/ESXi) and the remainder attributed to newer solutions for networking, hybrid cloud management, end-user computing, and storage.
The key business implication of this shift is the fact that more than half of VMware’s business now belongs within a solution portfolio which is growing at 30% year-to-year, as opposed to the slowing, virtualization space.
For its part, VMware warned that faster growth for hybrid cloud and SaaS could have what it called a “delaying effect” on total revenue growth. Revenues from hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings are currently around 6% of total revenues.
