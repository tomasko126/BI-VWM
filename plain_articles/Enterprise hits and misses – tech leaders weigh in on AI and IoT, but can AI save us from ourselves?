Diginomica picks – my top four stories on diginomica this week
Cloud service adoption is not a cost-cutting exercise – Never thought I’d see anyone besides Phil Wainewright attempt to compare cloud service adoption  to the five stages of grief – but Kurt Marko pulls it off. The vinegar is on the house:
Remember these points the next time you hear the cloud-is-more-expensive straw man being trotted out to justify keeping your outdated private data centers. Arguing just on cost is like criticizing an iPhone because it’s more expensive than a flip phone.

Calories and community, weight and wellness – the digital reinvention of WeightWatchers – Stuart has put WeightWatchers on the digital scale for years. No one better than him to weigh in on the branding change to WW, marking a strategic push to wellness, not just weight. Also see Stuart’s analysis of Salesforce’s Q3 shopping index as we head into the all-important season for retailers.
Parkinson’s UK takes battle for a cure to the cloud with Snowflake Computing – We don’t have a cure for Parkinson’s yet, but the progress is notable. Jess tells the story of how Parkinson’s UK is joining their data with Snowflake, in a push for crucial insights.
The ‘Father of the Web’ wants a new contract to redeem his troubled child –  Sir Tim Berners-Lee calls for a new contract for the World Wide Wide, amidst the data exploitation of monstrous data vampires Silicon Valley darlings that are acting beyond accountability. Derek shares the strategy behind this ambition – and why control of our personal data is at the center.

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. The fall season is winding down, but diginomica is still tarmacking. Here’s a few from the road:

FocusConnect 2018 – a sit down with the CEO – Chris meets with JDA Software CEO Girish Rishi to get his take on JDA’s push into AI, machine learning, and edge analytics.

More picks from my itinerary absurdia:

How Adore Me stepped off the BI rollercoaster and brought self-service analytics to business users – A use case highlight from Looker JOIN, thanks to the rough edges.
Inside the surprising Workplace by Facebook – what I learned from Workplace product leaders – Vive la contradictions.
How Talend mobilizes the data behind Domino’s digital deliveries –  The so-called “360 degree view of the customer” is often promised, but rarely delivered. So where does Domino’s stand on this?

A couple more vendor picks:

Microsoft’s Future Decoded – it’s all about AI and ethics – Martin
FinancialForce and the quest to remake midmarket ERP for a digital world – Phil

Jon’s grab bag – In the wake of hate crimes where the perpetrators left a disturbing online trail, Jerry asks a tough question: Is it time to is pull the plug on hate speech online? Can AI help? (Me: yeah, “AI,” even in its current clunky form, can help, but it can’t save us from ourselves either).
Den argues for an expanded view of developer ethics in Could the new kingmakers turn us into puppets? He quotes from a piece on AI ethics: “Governments and citizens alike need to be far more proactive about setting the AI agenda.” Yep, that’s you and me. Finally, Den navel gazes slices and dices diginomica’s own results from a Gartner tech strategy assessment in Do you know your ETA from your elbow? (Yes, the diginomica team took a Gartner survey, like I said, vive la contradictions).
Best of the rest
My top four picks from the enterprise blogosphere this week:

Tech Leaders Look To IoT, AI & Robotics To Fuel Growth Through 2021 – Louis Columbus parses data from a global KPMG survey on the real world impact of the biggest tech buzzwords, including blockchain. Most useful? Notes and charts on the most impacted industries by technology.
The next finance transformation starts with the CFO – McKinsey delves into CFO disruptions – transform or fall behind. The biggest problem – only a small percentage of CFOs are using automation, and only 25 percent have digitized their finance function. Yet CFOs are expected to do more – today.
The Most Important Thing about B2B Personas-Common Ground – Gartner’s Hank Barnes throws some productive cold water on the B2B personas fad cure-all-du-jour marketing rage: “The rush to personas continues in B2B.  But the value returned from that investment sure feels questionable.” But hey – don’t cancel your personas infographic on my behalf.
CRM’s Oligopoly – Not sure if the CRM market is mature enough to justify an oligopoly. Or, to put it another way, the omni-channel hasn’t been conquered and thus I see openings. But – Denis Pombriant has a useful overview of the key players he sees.

Honorable mention 
Will Putting a Red Hat On Make IBM Cool Now? – If you’re not Red Hatted out yet, TEC’s PJ Jakovljevic piles on.
5 nations now demanding Mark Zuckerberg testify on Facebook’s data misuse – The water’s getting hotter, but will Facebook take a bath?
Overcoming IT project failure – Josh Greenbaum on how ProQ wants to change project outcomes – An overdue podcast with Josh and yours truly: “Up to 2/3 of all enterprise software projects fail to deliver their expected value. Will your project be one of them?”
Whiffs
Always tough to narrow to three whiffs amidst the PR flotsam and miscellaneous buffoonery, but that’s my job this week. But first, your “who says tech isn’t sexy?” headline awards:

Are You Ready For Sex Robots? Too Bad, They’re Already Here. Trying to conjur snark but it’s already pretty awkward. Aldous Huxley on line one.
Marines who drew phallic flight pattern in sky grounded – I detect a pattern here.
Under Armour employees no longer allowed to expense strip club visits – tough setback. Thankfully, as we’ve noted, robotics is stepping in.

Cue the whiffs. Start with a blue screen travel fail:

.@qmacro another addition to our travel signage fails series… a Windoze treat – the ever-helpful “Privacy checkup” screen 🙂 pic.twitter.com/ws45QuAniP

Oh, and back to Jerry’s point on machines screening hate speech – not necessarily, as Twitter just reminded us, via the social media spank tunnel they created and now get to experience for themselves: Twitter Listed A Trending Topic For “Kill All Jews” After A Brooklyn Synagogue Was Vandalized.
On a lighter, culinary note:

Swiss researchers are playing Led Zeppelin to cheese https://t.co/RkciYve4TP
-> LMAO @ “When the Omelet Breaks” and “Melty Mountain Hop”

And if your levee is breaking because some schmucks got voted into office this week, take heart in this perfect duck. Ducks > schmucks.
