The Crown Commercial Service isn’t everyone’s favourite organisation in Whitehall, where it has somewhat of a reputation for continuing to play by the ‘old-school’ rules, whilst also being ruthless in its execution. There is also a bit of tension between it and the cooler kids in town, the Government Digital Service.
It’s old world versus new world. It’s suits and schmoozing versus jeans, plaid shirts and creative break-out sessions. It’s corporate versus co-operative.
I know which I’d prefer to be working for, but that’s besides the point. It seems that for all the negative rhetoric, according to its first annual report and accounts, the Crown Commercial Service has delivered some cold, hard cash savings over the past year to the UK public sector.
Some £5.9 billion in fact, which if it is a sign of things to come is nothing to be sniffed at considering the billions of pounds worth of savings that are expected from departments over the next parliament.
And plenty of these savings have come from the Crown Commercial Service simply reevaluating the government’s current relationships with suppliers, as well as reducing the barriers to entry for new, smaller, more agile suppliers going forward.
Commenting on the organisation’s first annual report, Chief executive Sally Collier said:
CCS was formally established 12 months ago, to bring together procurement operations for common goods and services, policy development and the strategic commercial functions within the Cabinet Office, forming a single integrated organisation that supports departments and the wider public sector to deliver increased savings and better commercial outcomes for government.
CCS represents an important component of government’s wider commercial capability and, throughout the year, has maintained a relentless focus on its core aim to deliver savings through a combination of: Establishing and leveraging centralised deals for common goods and services; Managing procurement expenditure on behalf of customers through delivering managed services; Providing specialist advisory support to departments on their complex commercial transactions and; Managing the Crown’s relationship with its strategic suppliers
 And these are all areas that the UK government needs a significant amount of help with. Whitehall departments have a very chequered past when it comes to commercial savviness, where they have been known to be able to do little about failing agreements with suppliers, simply because of their poor contract negotiations and management.
For example, there was the NHS’ National Programme for IT contract with CSC, where the government was responsible for paying CSC hundreds of millions of pounds for systems that it didn’t deliver. It also had to pay £100 million to renegotiate the contract and then promise CSC a £100 million bonus if it achieved a new set of milestones, despite having failed to achieve the previous ones.
Sounds all commercially sensible, right? Not.
And this is where the Crown Commercial Service has played a strong role over the past year or so. The annual report notes that savings made to date come from £1.9 billion price-related savings from centralised procurement of common goods and services, £1.6 billion of demand savings from government spend on consultancy and contingent labour and £2.4 billion from leveraging relationships with suppliers and spending controls.
It also highlighted the following examples:
• By reducing barriers to entry for government buyers and enabling over 1,500 small and medium sized businesses to provide IT cloud based services, G-Cloud is showing an average of 20% savings against prior legacy based, single vendor agreements.
• Agreeing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with major IT hardware suppliers resulted in product discounts with the potential of £3m p.a. Savings.
• £85m of savings delivered through supporting central government departments on software audits.
• A renegotiation of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency’s IT contracts, releasing £57m savings over three years to be channelled towards new digital initiatives.
As a side note, it’s interesting that CCS is putting G-Cloud average savings at around 20%, when previously the government has touted figures as high as 50%. But that’s one for another day…
The annual report also gave us some insight into what savings we can expect over the coming year, which it anticipates will be somewhat lower than what it achieved in 2014/15. This isn’t entirely unexpected, given that the Crown Commercial Service will have gone all guns blazing for the obvious areas to restrict spend and will now have to become a bit more sophisticated to squeeze further savings. It notes:
As we move forward in 2015/16, there will be a relentless focus on savings delivery, increasing managed service provision within central government and potentially into the wider public sector and on continued capability improvement.
CCS is aiming to deliver between £800m and £1bn savings against a 2014/15 baseline through continued leverage of savings from spend on common goods and services, advisory support to departments’ most complex commercial transactions and through strategic supplier management.
My take
It may not be the most popular organisation in Whitehall, but it certainly is pulling in some good headline figures. Central government seriously needed an injection of commercial savviness.
Questions remain, however, about its future role as government departments, driven by the Government Digital Service, continue to shift away from the old way of doing things and move towards building more of their own systems, using commodity off-the-shelf IT and signing smaller, shorter contracts.
But given the rate of change is likely to take some time, I think CCS has a few more good years in it yet…
