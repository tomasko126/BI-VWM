A strong end to 2016 has set up ServiceNow for expansion in 2017 as the number of multi-product and $1 million+ deals increases.
For the fourth quarter, ServiceNow reported earnings of $42.4 million on revenue of $391.7 million, up 37% year-on-year. For the full year, the firm reported a net loss of $451.8 million on revenue of $1.39 billion, up 38% year-on-year. 
Subscriptions revenue rose 43% in Q4 to $350.3 million, while professional services revenue was up 1% at $41.4 million. Subscription “billings” rose 52% year-on-year to $483.9 million. 
In the fourth quarter, the firm clocked up a record 27 new deals greater than $1 million in net new annualized contract value, and 31 net new Global 2000 customer wins. In addition, 18 of the top 20 new deals inQ4 involved more than three products. Some 72% of all customers are now multi-product users. 
CEO Frank Slootman made the case on the company’s earnings call that ServiceNow’s footprint in the market is now so strong that it’s becoming the first port of call for prospects: 

Customers are dropping all pretence that there is anybody else in the mix. They’re conceding that, ‘You guys are the ones,’ and it goes from there.

Of note, IT Operations Management made up 21% of fourth quarter revenues, leading Slootman to reiterate the company’s goal of having ITOM make up 15% of annual revenues by 2020 perfectly within reach: 

The pairing of ITOM and ITSM is very strategic. It’s a key reason for customers to swallow the entire platform strategy instead of small subsets.

It all sets up ServiceNow for a good 2017, argues Sanjay Medvitz, Analyst with Technology Business Research: 

ServiceNow’s efforts to broaden its portfolio and expand its reach beyond its core ITSM business over the past few years are paying dividends, evidenced by 54% growth of initial ACV in 2016. ServiceNow also continues to improve its mix of emerging products which accounted for 46% of new ACV in 4Q16, up from 29% in the year-ago quarter. TBR expects ServiceNow to maintain strong double-digit growth throughout 2017 as it continues to scale out new revenue streams and push towards its annual revenue goal of $4 billion in 2020.

Expansion
Expansion of company headcount is now planned, with the intention of having 6,000 global employees next year, up from 4,800 today. International expansion is also a goal with 68% of revenues currently coming from North America with 24% from EMEA and 8% from the rest of the world. 
It’s indicative of ServiceNow’s increasing relevance in the market that Accenture yesterday took action to bolster its ServiceNow practice via the acquisition of solid servision, a Germany-based privately owned consulting and system integration company.  This boosts Accenture’s global ServiceNow practice with 100 professionals with more than 130 ServiceNow certifications to Accenture.
Dr. Tilo Steinmeier, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of solid servision, commented:


solid servision’ focus has always been delivery of excellence by having the exceptional technical and consulting skills and broad experience needed to leverage the cloud with the most complex customer demands in IT and non-IT. Combining solid servision and Accenture capabilities will bring unparalleled quality and scale to our clients when implementing ServiceNow and solve their IT business challenges more rapidly.

The acquisition of solid servision follows the acquisition of Nashco, which operates in the Canadian ServiceNow market, in November 2016.
