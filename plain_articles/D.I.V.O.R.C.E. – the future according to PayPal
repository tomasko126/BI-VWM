Dan Schulman
We continue to help shape the transformation of digital and mobile payments around much of the world.
That’s the clear mission statement for Dan Schulman, CEO Designate at PayPal, when the firm begins trading independently on Monday morning. In this task, he’s helped, he argues, by PayPal’s public profile:
PayPal was named as one of the top 100 brands throughout the world in a recent study; and in countries like Australia and the UK we rank as one of the top 10 most trusted brands. This trust helps to drive both acquisition and engagement. Also, in a recent study, US consumers who plan to make their first mobile payment in a physical store in the next six months were asked how they would choose to pay. Over 70% said they would trust PayPal over others with that transaction. That brand preference is a powerful asset as we look towards the future.
While this brand trust is high, there is room for improvement, Schulman says:
On July 1, we extended our Buyer Protection program to cover not only physical products, but also intangible goods and services, including digital goods, digital music, digital books, digital games, travel tickets, and software downloads. As a result, PayPal now offers Buyer Protection on 99% plus of everything bought on our platform. We believe this is a industry-leading value proposition and that was enabled by our world-class risk and data analytics teams.
Customer engagement is a top priority as a result, he adds:
We want to create a value proposition that inspires the average PayPal customer to use our app two times to three times a week versus the two times to three times per month they use PayPal today. And while that is a significant stretch goal for us, we already see this type of usage pattern with our Venmo users. For a generation that has never written a check ,Venmo is the way to pay the rent, pay back a friend, and it is in the middle of how the millennial generation manage and moves their money.
The numbers
As PayPal prepares to spin out on its own, Schulman can point to some powerful stats to back up his claims that the future will be bright:

1.1 billion transactions processed in the most recent quarter, up 27% year-on-year.
Transactions per active account rose year-on-year from 21 times to 24 times in the most recent quarter.
Mobile transactions make up 30% of total transactions, up 42% year-on-year.

That last number is of particular pride for Schulman who says:
We see ourselves as a mobile-first platform and the majority of our development efforts continue to support our innovation across mobile payments and digital commerce. Being a trusted way to pay in today’s most popular apps is helping to drive this increase in mobile engagement. Across not only online and in-app, but importantly, we are seeing the very beginning of our in-store strategy play out.
We are now live with 67% of the top 100 mobile merchants. Importantly, we are making initial strides in powering the in-store mobile shopping experiences developed by our merchant partners. The Paydiant powered Subway app became the number two downloaded food and beverage iOS app in the US in June and is now available across 30,000 plus stores. And in collaboration with Tillster we announced the national rollout of PayPal as a way to pay at 5,000 Burger King stores.
PayPal on a certain Watch
Ongoing investment in new technology will be a key part of the PayPal strategic direction, promises Schulman:
A great example of our new flexibility and speed to market is One Touch. One Touch is the most significant improvement to our checkout experience in the past 5 plus years. One Touch lets people pay with just a single touch on any mobile phone, tablet and desktop, across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems. It removes almost all friction from the checkout experience.
One Touch was started on our Braintree platform, but as we’ve integrated the PayPal and Braintree software stacks, we were able to migrate its functionality within six months to our traditional PayPal payment flows in the US, UK, and Canada, with many other markets targeted for later this year. And while it will take time to properly deploy One Touch through our various payment flows, we expect it to be available for over 50% of our U.S. transactions by year-end. Braintree continues to be the payments partner of choice for mobile disruptors and innovators.
A $600 billion market
PayPal will also be drilling down on moving ahead in the international remittance market, enabled by its $890 million acquisition of Xoom this month. Remittance is a $600 billion market that’s ripe for disruption, reckons Schulman:
Xoom lets people send money to, and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure fast and cost-effective way using their mobile phone, tablet or computer. And during the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, Xoom reported that its 1.3 million active customers sent roughly $7 billion to people in 38 different markets, including the Philippines, India, Mexico, Brazil and China. Xoom’s brand promise resonates with ours. They have a strong and engaged customer profile and a mobile and digital service orientation providing real and transparent value globally.
He concludes:
Technology should make managing and moving our money aright, not a privilege for just the affluent, and we believe our technology platform, global reach and trusted brand can move PayPal from being an occasional transaction to being an integral part of consumer’s financial life. Adding remittance capabilities bolsters our efforts to achieve that goal.
