Over the weekend, Brian Sommer put up an entertaining Tweet pointing to a New York Times article entitled: Meet the People Who Can’t Get Enough Hotel Points (You’ll Learn Something). The article is a discussion about the goings on at TIPPLE, short for The (Marriott) Insider Points, Pints and Liquor Extravaganza.
That article and Sommer’s Tweet about Marriot Rewards ‘junkies’ drew a response from yours truly:

This is social media gold: “…the website was a low-cost focus group of unmatched authenticity, and its gatherings a delightful meetup of passionate travelers.” With which Marriott has largely been ‘hands-off.’ Extremely rare. https://t.co/lRbUvf6CfZ

Much of what I read about the future of social media from those providing tools for that market focuses on how to game Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter for sales an marketing purposes. Anyone opening the digital pages of LinkedIn today would be hard pressed to see it as much more than the latest dumping ground for marketing content rather than the CV repository it started out as.
I’d go further and argue that ‘social media’ has morphed so far away from its original intent of fostering conversations around topics of interest that it has largely become a cesspool of ads and marketing crap that allow marketers to breathe life into otherwise failed campaigns.
So reading the story of TIPPLE was an extraordinary breath (sic) of fresh air. What is TIPPLE, or rather the rewards community around it? Check this from the NYT story:
To the contributors who gathered at the Renaissance Arlington Capital View (on their own points — or, surprisingly, dimes), they are merely a digital band of travel enthusiasts who prize frugality, brand loyalty and friendships built on intermingled passions.
But that undersells what is an unwitting wider influence: With every answered question and shared strategy, they act as screen-named guides to a lucrative world governed by “Megabonus” promotions and fine print, category changes and free night certificates. Their insights — fueled by a mix of practice, speculation and maybe a bit of projection — are an open-ended Google search away.
The short version is that these are fanatical travel geeks who, in the words of Marriot executive David Flueck:
…will know more about our portfolio than I will.
That degree of expertise and, most importantly, authority, comes through:
…experience and a near-lawyerly attention to detail are what make the Arlington crowd particularly powerful: They are travelers who can write with authority about properties and perks at Marriott-branded hotels around the world.
As I implied in my Tweet, Marriott oversees and moderates the community but is largely hands-off. And how does this work? According to Roger Nicholson, an exec with more than 3 million lifetime points to his credit:
You’re rooting for people to have great trips. You share ideas and thoughts and the bad things. You share that, and over time, those stories become friendships.
One word? Relationship.
Marriott gets it. Former Marriott exec Thom Kozik says:
If I could communicate to a handful of those members the true value of the program or the true capabilities the program afforded them, they were going to be a far better ambassador to their friends and families than my emails or websites ever would be.
How about an example? Check this Tweet:

Gotta love when you wake up to a BIG BIG Box of chocolates in your room from @MarriottSF! I love @MarriottRewards they get me!
🍫🍫
Chocolate is made from a plant so technically this is a vegetable and totally OK to eat for breakfast right?

Notice how many people are talking about this or re-Tweeting it? But unadulterated fandom aside, Marriott is taking customer care through this channel seriously.

RT MarriottRewards “Xialater Hi X! There is a know issue with Lifetime points and nights displaying incorrectly for some people and we’re working to get it fixed. If you have a question about your balance please DM with your Marriott Rewards number. Thanks!”

My take
Social media done right isn’t hard or complicated. Yet control freakery combined with the overwhelming urge to fill a sales pipeline has left a stain on the incumbent networks that is hard to imagine getting cleaned up any time soon. But it is possible to nurture a highly knowledgeable community and still push messages to them.
Marriott has demonstrated that when you set something up and allow the community to come together in its own time and in its own way then good things happen that benefits everyone. The proof is in the eating. That community now spans more than 160,000 people on one Twitter account alone recording close to 640,000 Tweets over a nine-year period. The European version has more than 20,000 people from a standing start in 2016.
Unfortunately, too many businesses have viewed these networks as a cheap way to do the same old marketing as they always did, forgetting the customer experience along the way.
