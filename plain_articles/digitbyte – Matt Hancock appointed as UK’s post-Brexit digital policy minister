Musical chairs now as the new UK government under Prime Minister Theresa May takes shape.
Last week, Matt Hancock was ousted as Minister for the Cabinet Office, where he was in charge of the Government Digital Service (GDS), replaced by Ben Gummer.
Hancock’s fate was unclear to begin with, but late on Friday evening it emerged that he is moving to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport where he becomes Minister of State responsible for digital policy.

In that role, he replaces Ed Vaizey, who is leaving government office to return to the backbenches.

Vaizey caused a stir last week when he announced that the UK’s starting point on post-Brexit data protection would be to align with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
But his departure from office may owe more to his backing of two other leadership candidates before giving his backing to May.
My take
With those changes in place, the new digital agenda team is now in situ.
While Gummer remains an unknown quantity in terms of his digital savvy, I’m glad we haven’t lost Hancock. Over the past few months, he’s articulated some sound digital vision thinking that it would have been a waste to cast aside.
