Lead story – AI risks, debates, and coaching networks – stories by Kurt Marko and Phil Wainewright

MyPOV: Kurt and Phil had different takes on humans-versus-AI this week. It all depends if you think humans are phone-addicted sloths the problem or the solution (brilliant problem solvers). Let’s hope it’s the latter.
In Beware the AI risks of over-automation and hyper convenience, Kurt argues that the biggest AI risks are not Terminator-esque doomsdays but complacency from over-automation and hyperconvenience. How we design these systems is the crux. Kurt:
Intelligent machines and systems shouldn’t just be designed for manual override, but with guardrails that reinforce higher level human skills and impede the skills atrophy that happens with continual reliance on automation.
Phil put on the provocateur hat in Why humans will always be smarter than artificial intelligence:
Computers are much better than us at only one thing — at matching known patterns. They can only match the patterns they have learned, and they have limited capacity to learn more than just a few patterns. Humans are optimized for learning unlimited patterns, and then selecting the patterns we need to apply to deal with whatever situation we find ourselves in.
Some readers begged to differ (check the sparkling comment thread). I give Phil the short-term edge. Humans will harness machine learning to augment what we do best (and, ideally, free us up to do more creative/adaptive stuff). But as for generalized AI, no matter what HAL 9000 says, that project has barely begun, and no one knows the outcome.
Phil resolves the argument (for now) in Are coaching networks the big new thing in enterprise software? (1/2):
The coaching network replaces the idea of AI and humans as adversaries or competitors with a mutually beneficial collaboration that plays to the strengths of each. For all the impressive feats that machine learning and artifical intelligence can show off today, AI is still just a pattern recognition engine.
Guess the robot wars will have to wait…
Diginomica picks – my top three stories on diginomica this week

Walmart stumbles and the Avon lady gets lost – Stuart posted retail reckonings. Clean up on aisle nine in Walmart bombs as Wall Street gets a bad case of ‘Amazon panic’. Meanwhile, the Avon Lady isn’t making digital house calls in Ding dong, digital calling! Why the Avon Lady badly needs a modernizing makeover.  Contrast that with Home Depot’s apparently Amazon-proof model.
True 1-1 marketing isn’t segment or persona-based – Conversant’s AI personalization story – I’ve got some questions on how anonymous data is used for 1:1 marketing without breaching privacy. But an interesting look by Barb nonetheless.

Special best of – diginomica/government launch review
You may have noticed something different around these parts: diginomica/government got a makeover/relaunch/proper landing as a diginomica subdomain. Here’s my best-of picks to get you going:

Rising to the challenge – diginomica/government steps up – Derek reveals the reasons behind our latest evil plans. Teaser: “Digital government has reached a critical juncture… We are concerned.”
Some ideas to get GDS back on track – disruption is needed – Derek struck a chord with readers by speaking out against The UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) (“it’s flailing”) – and breaking out what it needs to get back on track.
A frank conversation with Infor’s head of Europe about Brexit – Derek strikes again, this time with another look at one of the defining issues in EMEA, aka Brexit, aka the election that started it all.
Capgemini sees growth in US, following wind-down of HMRC’s Aspire – Stuart looks at how Capgemini is ramping up digital and cloud services in the US and Europe as the big ticket outsourcing deals “morph or wind down.”

Jon’s grab bag – Speaking of diginomica team content, you may want to check my roundup of diginomica’s workplace diversity topics (Close the digital skills gap and gain the talent edge – lessons from diginomica’s diversity coverage).
Really only one grab bag item this week, Den’s turbo-musings: Unless you’re careful, the Millennial mindset will confuse GenX and Boomers. “Millennials think differently” – Den explains his recent cold shower encounter. Are developers the real creative thinkers? Den has problems with that.  Bonus: Den’s deconstruction of the “daily tsunami of consulting babble larded with buzzword bingo lingo.”
Best of the rest
 Lead story – Lawsuits threaten infosec research — just when we need it most by Zack Whittaker

myPOV: Now here’s the kind of enterprise story we don’t get enough of. A fight-the-power exposé against the  bowl-circling stool pigeons corporate interests that want to squelch white hats from bringing security problems to light. Whittaker’s article is jammed with anecdotes like this:
It’s no surprise, given the legal risk to researchers, that few wanted to speak on the record about the threats they had faced. But one researcher did — and spoke frankly of when he was sued for slander as a result of findings in his early security work.
Not a feel-good story, but one white hatter gives us a reason to care:
“The selfish part of me is, of course, terrified of going to prison or being sued into oblivion again,” he said. “But then the altruistic part of me is still inside there somewhere yelling Spock’s famous line: ‘The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few!'”
Honorable mention

What is Design Thinking? – I need to add a couple caveats into the comments, but nonetheless, a solid overview by the Agile Elephant team on one of their eight digital transformation building blocks. (Check the link for more on the Global Legal Hackathon in London this weekend!)
The Strongest Differentiator – A Different Point of View – Hank Barnes sees a lot of enterprise blandness in his quest for differentiating tactics. Here’s a field example that passes muster.
AI ripe for exploitation, experts warn – Not a surprising or terribly interesting piece, but the 100 page AI report noted is worth a download.
Davos debrief Part 1 – Vinnie Mirchandani scores his Davos debrief, filtering the enterprise lessons.
Why Multicloud Will Win When the Cloud Wars Go Global – yep, though managing those multi-clouds won’t be so dreamy.
Three different ways The Atlantic, Digiday, and Condé Nast approach reader monetization – readers dug this use-case-heavy piece from Parse.ly.

Whiffs
When the police have to beg citizens not to call for emergency assistance because KFC ran out of chicken, we might not be at the peak of western civilization anymore. But KFC’s failure does bring meaty (sorry!) enterprise lessons, as Den found in KFC losing minimum of £4.2 million a week in supply chain debacle.
Do we want companies to have more personality on Twitter? Yes. But what if that personality is a sarcastic wanker? That’s the dilemma raised by Booking.com in their rather amazing tweet to me this week:

Hi Jon, we like to stalk our guest. Of course, you can choose to don’t be stalked and opt out of our newsletter. You can do it easily following this link: https://t.co/qAHMj26IZf.

A for honesty if nothing else. I’m generally sympathetic to travel stress, though I wouldn’t have gone so far as to go through the x-ray machine to avoid getting separated from my handbag. On the aromatic travel side:

The media is buzzing over this female Olympic skier: How An Average American Skier Managed To Scheme Her Way Into The Olympics. As for “I want to show others that freestyle skiing is possible and it is never too late to get into this sport,” well, I’d say you showed us how to game an algorithm. Facebook got gamed this week too:

Finally, Ben Thompson of Stratechery is a seriously smart dude, even if he does lather his self-created aggregation theory onto everything like intellectual mayonnaise Arby’s special sauce. But in The Aggregator Paradox, Thompson boxes himself into an ideological corner by arguing that only the giants (Facebook and Google) have the power to save us from rogue ad tech media models (granted, he does slap Facebook around a few times).
Maybe Thompson is right – I hope not – but either way, that is some dytopian [email protected] there dude. I hope Mr. Thompson doesn’t mind if those of us pushing new models carry on, rather than submit to the publishers’ purgatory of Facebook’s Instant Articles. To ease us into embracing this duopoly in order to get the user experience we want, Thompson says:
In other words, we can have our cake and eat it too — and it’s free to boot. Hopefully it’s not poisonous.
Oh it’s poisonous all right Mr. Thompson. And some of the cakes were baked in Russia; their ingredients taste pretty bad for democracy. Give me independent media with all its partisan absurdities over this cultural black hole you call “aggregators.”
And on that note, I’ll just say that some very brave and articulate young people made me a little less jaded this week. I can do that without getting too political on you right? Because courage isn’t left or right. See you next time…
