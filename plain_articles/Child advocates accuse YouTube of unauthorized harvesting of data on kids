While we all wait to find out today if we’re one of the 87 million people whose data Mark Zuckerberg and Co have been sharing around, Google’s next in the data privacy sights as YouTube is accused of harvesting data on millions of children.
An alliance of child advocacy organizations has teamed up with privacy groups to file a complaint in the U.S. with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that Google is in breach of the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This requires parental consent to data collection on websites that are used by children. The 59 page FTC complaint alleges:
Google’s violations are particularly egregious. Google had actual knowledge of both the large number of child-directed channels on YouTube and the large numbers of children using YouTube. Yet, Google collected personal information from nearly 25 million children in the U.S over a period of years and used this data to engage in very sophisticated digital marketing techniques. Google’s wrongdoing allowed it to profit in two different ways. Google has not only made a vast amount of money by using children’s personal information as part of its ad networks to target advertising, but has also profited from advertising revenues from ads on its YouTube channels that are watched by children.
There are a number of specific accusations leveled in relation to breaches of COPPA:

YouTube does not have a children’s privacy policy.
YouTube makes no effort to provide direct parental notice.
YouTube fails to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collecting personal information from children.

YouTube’s position is that it’s not intended as a kids site and that it created a child friendly app in 2015 for precisely that reason. The small print in the Terms of Service state:
You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use the Service. There are lots of other great web sites for you. Talk to your parents about what sites are appropriate for you.
An ‘age gate’ is in place which blocks anyone attempting to set up an account using a birthdate that is less than 13 years ago. But while you need to be 13 or more to post a video, you don’t in order to watch one. In addition, the company’s privacy policy makes no reference to children, which leads the complainants to argue:
There is no reason to think that YouTube treats information collected from children any differently than that collected from other users.
Kids and YouTube
The coalition of groups insists that YouTube is perfectly aware that children use its service. The complaint reads:
YouTube, owned by Google, is the most popular online platform among children. A 2017 study found that 80% of U.S. children ages 6-12 use YouTube daily. Child-directed channels such as ChuChuTV Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs and Ryan ToysReview are among the most popular channels on YouTube. Many of the top children’s channels are part of the Google Preferred “Parenting & Family” lineup. Major advertisers pay Google a premium to guarantee that their ads will be placed on these popular YouTube channels.
YouTube also has actual knowledge that many children are on YouTube, as evidenced by disclosures from content providers, public statements by YouTube executives, and the creation of the YouTube Kids app, which provides additional access to many of the children’s channels on YouTube. YouTube even encourages content creators to create children’s programs for YouTube through the YouTube Partner Program.
The second most popular YouTube channel in the U.S, with 12 million subscribers and over 20 billion views, is Ryan ToysReview, which is billed as “for kids, by kids”. Google profits from YouTube’s kid-targeted programming. It brought in $11 million in ad revenue in a single year, of which YouTube would be entitled to 45%.
The complaint claims that 75% of children between six and twelve use YouTube. If proven and if the charge of violating the protection act were upheld, that could have enormous implications for Google. The penalties laid down by the act allow for up to $41,484 per violation.
To support its claims of YouTube’s child audience, the complainants cite a 2017 study – Smarty Pants Brand Love Study which found:
A whopping 96% of kids ages 6-12 are aware of YouTube, and 94% say they either love (71%) or like (24%) it! With awareness and love comes usage. In 2017, 90% of kids who know the brand say they use it, 83% of whom do so daily… The frequency of YouTube engagement continues to rise. This year, 65% of kid users use the app/site several times a day—up 20 percentage points since 2015.
The complaint against YouTube also dismisses the idea that kids may be watching with their parents or guardians:
Many children watch YouTube on mobile devices, decreasing the likelihood that they are co-viewing with their parents. Over half of YouTube’s total viewing time now occurs on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets…Parents also encourage children to enjoy solo-viewing experiences on mobile devices as a means of quiet self-entertainment. In fact, over half of parents in a recent survey indicated that they let their children use iPads “to get them out of their hair”.
The complainants argue that the YouTubeKids app does not provide YouTube with a defence, noting that when the app was launched the children’s content on the main site remained where it was rather than being transferred exclusively to the new app. It cites a study by Common Sense Media in which 71% of parents said their children watched YouTube either on its main website (44%) or on the YouTube app (37%) with only 24% saying they used the kids app.
The complainants are: The Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Center for Media Justice, Common Sense, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Federation of California, Consumers Union (the advocacy division of Consumer Reports), Corporate Accountability, Consumer Watchdog, Defending the Early Years, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), New Dream, Obligation, Inc., Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, Parents Across America, Parents Television Council, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, The Story of Stuff Project, TRUCE (Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Childhood Entertainment), and USPIRG.
My take
This is only the opening salvo in what will certainly be a long-running battle, the outcome of which can’t be predicted. That’s assuming the FTC takes up the case – it’s pursued around 24 cases in the 20 years since COPPA became law, but in the current climate, the appetite for action is higher than it’s been for years.
Kids watch YouTube. Any attempt to deny that is ludicrous. I know a six year old who’s obsessed with Taylor Swift and watches her videos on his iPad. He’s hardly alone in that. Every kid I know has the YouTube app on their tablet or their phone.
It’s interesting to note comments made by YouTube’s Director of Public Policy and Government Relations, Juniper Downs when she was giving evidence to a Fake News inquiry in the UK House of Commons. Asked how YouTube differentiates between adult and child consumption of content, she said:
We don’t look at adult consumption versus child consumption.
That may be a policy that comes back to haunt YouTube.
