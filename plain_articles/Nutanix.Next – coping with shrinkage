Nutanix shows signs of falling between a number of stools, most notably its identity as a hardware/software company when arguably it should be moving to software only and still standing very much in the on-premise ballpark when the hype machines are shouting ‘cloud’.
So the chance at the company’s recent .Next conference in Vienna to dig over this particular patch of dirt with CEO Dheeraj Pandey was grabbed with both hands. This was not least because the Nutanix position is now arguably a good example of the hybrid business model, proposed by Professor Nathan Furr, working in practice. 
Nutanix does seem to have hit a sweet spot in the compromise between on-premise and cloud operations that may allow businesses to move from one to the other – or hop between the two – as their business needs grow and change.But would the Nutanix stock price be higher if it didn’t have a hardware side to the business?
It is an argument that would seem to hold water, as it means running two separate business streams in order to make it work. Why not leave the hardware to its OEM partners? Pandey says:

There are a few reasons. One is that if we didn’t have our own route to market, control of our own destiny, the OEMs would not be honest. Look what happened with Brocade, which ended up with just six customers. They lost touch with their end customers. Direct access means that we know the channel directly, and whenever the OEMs won’t co-operate we compete. So it basically keeps it a level playing field. We understand logistics, hardware/software boundaries. And the appliance heritage makes our audience more successful, because we can tell them [the OEMs] what is best practice, and they can then do it at scale.

His position here is based on what view can be taken of the `software-defined datacenter’. Is it a new single entity or is it still made up of its separate parts? Pandey sides with the latter camp, which means having a good understanding of both parts.
Demarcations
Pandey sees an important part of the picture in being good at understanding the demarcations between hardware and software, particularly when it comes to creating software defined environments. Hardware is good at some things, and people understand how they fail, how to service and maintain them. As soon as this is flipped to a totally software-defined environment, he sees real potential for losing the goodness of that input, and risks throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
He sees this advantage outweighing the extras costs and the entirely separate line of management that is required. There is a philosophical argument underpinning this, for he sees pure software companies borrowing from the future to pay for the present, where they try to sell customers thousands of entitlements to use an application in advance. But very often that software ends up being shelfware. 

The cloud is the opposite of that, being based on a pay-as-you-grow annuity payment model. This latter model is the one Pandey feels customers now increasingly want:
Customers are thinking CapEx versus OpEx now. Do they want these monolithic deals costing millions of dollars and are highly risky? They don’t even know if they will use all the entitlements they have paid for. Or should they go for a model that is probably a little more expensive, but linear?  Then, if they need to spend more they can figure out what the volume looks like and only spend out on what they can use.

Nutanix is still targeting on-premise with, at best, the idea of moving users to the private cloud. So arguably it is still in that model of paying for the present by borrowing from the future. Pandey’s response, however, tips more than a hat to a level of pragmatism that may well strike a chord with many users. It is a good example of Professor Furr’s ‘hybrid business model’ approach:

The economics of the business have changed. Hardware costs are much lower – $5K rather than $5m – and the whole webscale architecture approach means you can bite-size it. So you can now scale out every month and the fabric will scale, as opposed to committing to a monolithic box that you must size up and capacity-plan for up front.

His pragmatic analysis here starts with a potential negative. While the marketing tag line at the company’s recent .Next conference in Vienna was ‘scale like Amazon’, the criticism will be that Amazon equals scaling in a couple of hours, while at best Nutanix means scaling `next week’. Pandey readily agrees with that, but points out that for many in the user community, ‘next week’ still represents ‘more than fast enough’:

We bring what has been a nine to 12 month gap down to a typical level of three or four weeks. And there are still changes going on here in bridging the gap between public to private cloud. We still need to figure out what needs to be done to bring procurement to provisioning time down, and we need to figure out what shrinking means for customers, for many now want to shrink environments.

The surrounding management to handle such possibilities, including the growing use of AI for predicting user workload/capacity requirements and the like, is already part of the Prism management environment, and will be an area for continued development work for Nutanix. This will include developments to meet the customers’ needs, especially in the areas of patterns of consumption. 
‘Shrinking’ hardware may not mean smaller boxes
Pandey’s use of the word ‘shrink’ is quite specific. The issue of users wanting to get rid of hardware that has become surplus to requirement is key. It is an area where Nutanix is still in the process of figuring out a solution. Possibilities, however, have to include some kind of leasing model to replace outright purchase. 
There is then also the option of opening up a new marketplace for leasing ‘pre-loved servers’. This could, indeed, make a good hybrid intermediate stage for users still concerned about moving away from on-premise operations. The business model would be a good learning curve for moving to the cloud, while the reality of on-premise appliances would give users the re-assurance of familiar operations. 
On the company’s relationship with SAP and the latter’s growing commitment to HANA and its in-memory processing model, Pandey offered some words of both caution and pragmatism:

Production environments still has to be cloned, backed up, replicated. You have to think of business continuity, all those mundane things. People have been kicking the tyres of HANA, but now it is moving into production and it still requires the same levels of lifecycle management, those things don’t change. If anything, in-memory is about the performance of the product, but in the end there is the whole eco-system of workflows around it that make the product successful.
SAP and Nutanix are very committed to figuring out how to virtualise HANA because, in AWS or Azure, it will be virtualised whether you like it or not. It will have to be agile in seconds, cloneable in seconds, moved around in seconds. That is the kind of velocity users are looking for. And over time HANA will have to work with more than the most expensive DDR4 RAM but something that is 10x, 100x cheaper.

My take
Professor Furr’s model suggests businesses, both users and vendors, should hybridise existing business tools and models with some elements of new alternatives, rather than risk jumping headlong into a whole new world. It is interesting to see that Nutanix not only understands that model, but also has clear views on the next steps that need to be taken.
