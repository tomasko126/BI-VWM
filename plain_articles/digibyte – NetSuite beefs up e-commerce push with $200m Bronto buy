With SuiteWorld just around the corner and quarterly numbers due out later today, NetSuite’s found time to slip in a quick acquisition announcement, beefing up its omnichannel e-commerce portfolio with an planned $200 million buy-out of email marketing firm Bronto Software.
According to a prepared statement, NetSuite CEO Zach Nelson sees this as transformational:
Just as customers demand seamless cross-channel shopping experiences, they increasingly expect companies to communicate consistently through all of their digital experiences – on site, at stores, in email or through social or mobile. By combining the two companies’ offerings and technology, we can help merchants deliver relevant and consistent digital commerce experiences throughout the customer journey.
Bronto’s checklist of functionality includes:

Messaging tools to personalize and execute on email, SMS and social campaigns.
Automation in the form of drag-and-drop tools to create multi-step automated campaigns, like cart recovery, ratings and reviews follow-up, post-purchase and welcome series.
Marketing CRM in the shape of list management and segmentation tools to assess engagement across all messaging channels.
Omnichannel capabilities including e-receipts and coupon management.

Existing Bronto customers include Armani Exchange, Timex, Gander Mountain, Trek and Boot Barn.
More on this after the NetSuite conference call.
Disclosure – at time of writing, NetSuite is a premier partner of diginomica.
