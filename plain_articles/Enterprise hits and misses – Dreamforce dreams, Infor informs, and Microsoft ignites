Lead story – diginomica does Dreamforce – my author picks

MyPOV: Dreamforce isn’t done, and neither is the keynote-swamped, story-chasing diginomica Dreamforce team. I can’t possibly do justice to our wall-to-wall coverage in one piece. Instead – here’s one top pick from each team member.

Dreamforce 2018 – Keith Block on integration, innovation and life as a co-CEO – Stuart scores a sit-down with a key player with a fresh job description.
Dreamforce 2018 – where are all the men? – Madeline on why gender equality matters to men as much as women, and how tech and societal changes tied into this non-profit Dreamforce panel.
Dreamforce 2018 – it’s all about integration, says Salesforce product chief Bret Taylor – Phil on his 1:1 with one of the execs that could impact Salesforce’s prospects the most.
Dreamforce 2018 – What do digital governments need? Rebels that can rebuild trust. Derek in his digital government wheelhouse.
Dreamforce 2018 – testing your liberal credentials – Dreamforce had a political backdrop, via Salesforce’s unflinching activism. Denis filed an early angle on the controversies, including Salesforce’s debated public sector contracts.

Oh, and as for Stuart hanging out with Metallica’s Lars Ulrich and not bringing me back a freaking drumstick, well, he’s got some ‘splainin’ to do. That’s a Harvester of Sorrow warning for you old school thrashers…

Even Metallica gets the @diginomica treatment. The full-on #DF18 use case, analysis, and a twist of rock n roll 🙂 https://t.co/OO2HlWxEt1

Inforum 2018 – Coleman AI takes center stage, and customers share their CloudSuite transitions. Here’s my first two pieces from Washington D.C. It was an important Inforum, with Infor needing to update its AI story while also guiding customers through their cloud transition questions.

Inforum 2018 – CEO Charles Phillips on Coleman AI and the problem of enterprise productivity
Inforum 2018 – Flint Hills Resources shares how pull off a rapid CloudSuite Financials implementation

Microsoft Ignite – Before Dreamforce kicked in, Phil put his former schoolmaster discerning gaze onto Microsoft’s ambitions:

AI, edge and security share top billing at Microsoft Ignite
Microsoft soups up Dynamics 365 with AI and HoloLens add-ons

Jon’s grab bag – a few edgy selections to round out proceedings: Brian shows HR vendors his slow cook BBQ skills in HR Tech vendors disappoint on the topics that matter to buyers. Jerry struck a chord with readers in California passes nation’s first IoT security bill – too little too late? Den stokes the fires of an argument that won’t – and shouldn’t – go away in Can AI be bounded by an ethical framework?
Best of the rest
 My top four picks from the enterprise blogosphere this week:

Phil Fersht of HfS Research gives RPA marketers that “it’s going to be a long-ass week” feeling stirs the RPA pot:

Man, we were trying to enjoy the RPA hype train but @pfersht is ruining the ride with his frustratingly sensible cautions and data, like:
-> “only 13% of RPA adopters are currently scaled up and industrialized” https://t.co/1kWsxNKtIZ

Three more:

Progress Report – ADP Analyst Day 2018 – Things are looking up – Constellation’s Holger Mueller has been “up” on ADP for a while – I guess things are really looking up this time! The vintage video/slide/blog combo is back.
Top 3 Questions SAP Hasn’t Answered About its New Digital Access Model – UpperEdge on its game – and just in time for SAP TechEd Vegas. SAP’s marketing team is surely grateful for this timing.
“Shadow IT” Goes Mainstream – Under the auspices of his new venture, Enterprise Alliance, Michael Doane shows us the data that makes him grouchy such a staunch advocate of business “users” (he hates the word user, but you get the drift): “Over the past ten years or so, we have seen a shift from chronically under-served business needs spawn the practice of shadow IT.”

Whiffs
Hard to pick four whiffs amidst all this buffoonery, but that’s my job this week:
I’m not sure if this is a whiff. Depends on how you feel about elven folk:

“Iceland’s hidden elves delay road projects” -> https://t.co/bRz3m4F4N7
Elves happen 🙂

That went well:

Thieves caught hours after stealing GPS tracking devices from tech company https://t.co/sPxtULztgb -> yup, we’ve got ourselves a #boneheadalert… stealing tracking devices is always an adventure. cc: @fscavo

The PR subject header of the week goes to:
Brands, it’s time to get naked and UNafraid!
Hmm – anyone recall asking a brand to get naked? Authenticity doesn’t mean a total absence of decorum. The pitch itself wasn’t bad:
This means baring all and embracing all of those online reviews – not just the good ones. Long gone are the days of burying bad online reviews – consumers, instead, want to see a genuine interaction.
Yep – brands should not be afraid to get into the fray. But as for “baring all,” that won’t be necessary. There is an implied whiff also. Most of the brands that dive into review conversations seem to be doing that shameless butt kissery pandering pap dance of “I”m sorry you had a bad experience.” Just once I’d like to see a brand say:
Please give us your contact info. We’ll contact you in ___ months when the problem is permanently corrected.
Like my Mom used to say when I (perpetually) found myself on the wrong side of her domestic rules, “Sorry means you won’t do it again.”
And finally, via Chris Paine and Den Howlett comes this keeper:

Loving that pretty much all the comments to this post are along lines of “What, was this woman mad?, where can we find a service that delivers weed and munchies in same box?” https://t.co/k4YOUDChk3

Now that would make event travel days a little better… see you next time.
If you find an #ensw piece that qualifies for hits and misses – in a good or bad way – let me know in the comments as Clive (almost) always does. I’m sure I skipped a few dandies this week.
