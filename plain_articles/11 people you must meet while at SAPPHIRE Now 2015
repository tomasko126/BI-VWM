You were expecting 10 – right? SAPPHIRE Now 2015 will be a monster show and it won’t be possible to get everything in that you’d like to. If your dance card isn’t already full then this is my top 11 list of people you should try and connect with and in no particular order.
Stacey Fish – SAP global communications. Stacey will hate me for doing this but she is THE person who can connect you to the best of media and analysts. Whatever you may think of those attendees, most have stories they’ve never written that can help you in your decision making.
Adam Wood – senior analyst Morgan Stanley does a ton of on the ground research with customers and partners. While Morgan’s may be on the sell side of the investor table, Adam is one of the good guys who knows this company better than most and can share what he really sees on the ground.
Hasso Plattner – co-founder SAP and still active in development. If you run into Hasso then don’t fear stopping him and asking your most difficult questions. He will almost certainly know the answer and always appreciates challenges.
Tom Grimes – Global CIO, ERP at GE – I hope he will be there and if you can track him down then he knows how to do ERP upgrades in less than 120 days. I will be sharing his story later today.
Geoff Scott – CEO ASUG, bats for the customer. ASUG has already held SAP’s feet to the fire over the business value of HANA. Ask him about successes the user group are seeing.
Paul Greenberg & Esteban Kolsky – these guys count as one and may be found at the Global Comms place. Their combined knowledge about CRM and the strategies that will move the customer needle is unparalleled. Always approachable, always insightful.
John Appleby – US business guy at Bluefin Solutions. Apart from his impeccable taste in suits, John has been all over HANA since its earliest days and is involved in large scale projects with lighthouse customers. He’ll tell you what works and what doesn’t.
Dick Hirsch – consultant with Atos has been probing SAP’s cloud technologies for a number of years and offers insights into how customers should think about SAP’s offerings in the context of a whole landscape.
Nayaki Nayar – SVP SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) will be showcasing some insanely good applications and services during the week. She can talk to how it fits together along with the all important analytics element. If that doesn’t make you sit up and go ‘wow’ then I don’t know what will.
Doug Henschen & Holger Mueller – again counting as one, Doug is a freshly minted Constellation analyst covering the so-called ‘big data’ topic but who has bags of project knowledge in ERP landscape. Holger is a rising HR analyst who has been an insider at SAP and seriously knows his stuff.
Aiaz Kazi – runs the validated startup program for SAP. I have a soft spot for Aiaz, largely because he is supportive of the kind of innovation you can’t find at just one vendor. The catalog of solutions is growing by the day so check in with him to find out if there’s a solution for gaps in your landscape.
So there’s my 11. Among others offered by the Facebook crowd:
Vijay Vijayasankar – the bar keep at your conference hotel and the barista at the Starbucks. You’re going to need refreshment, lots of it and the bars get busy.
Thomas Otter – someone further along the taxi queue than you. Yes, it will be a nightmare.
Omar Amer offered four – Simon Paris, Bernd Leukert, Steve Lucas, Steve Singh. All are good choices but my favorite would be Steve Singh who recently arrived from Concur.
Vinnie Mirchandani – posed the enigmatic ‘change your question to “around” from “at”, and I will tell you.’ Quite.
Adam Their – hunt down those who have turned an exceptional database into everything including a broken corkscrew. I have no idea what he means 😉
Disclosure: SAP is a premier partner and are covering most of my T&E. We will be videoing many of the above.
