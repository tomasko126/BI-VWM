While still be coming under fire over its response to brands appearing next to extremist content online, YouTube has just taken action to clamp down on fake channels making money from advertising. From now on, channels won’t be able to make money until their videos have generated 10,000 views.
It’s a major shift in policy to the YouTube Partner Program, which was launched back on 2007. This allow content products to sign up,uploading their work earn cash from advertising. But this easy access to the biggest video platform on the internet has a downside – it attracts unscuprulous individuals and companies who set up channels using stolen content.
To make it a bit less easy to profit from such theft, YouTube reckons that putting a level of 10,000 views will make it less attractive to the profiteers, but not be too high a target to reach as to deter genuine content creators. Getting to that level will also give YouTube a better chance to evaluate whether a channel is playing by the rules.
In a statement released Thursday, YouTube said:
Starting today, we will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views. This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted.
In a few weeks, we’ll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program. After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we’ll review their activity against our policies. If everything looks good, we’ll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules.
According to YouTube’s guidelines, there are two main type of fake content out there -impersonation of a channel or impersonation of an individual:
Impersonation of a channel – A user copies a channel’s profile, background, or text, and writes comments to make it look like somebody else’s channel posted the comments. If you feel that yours or another creator’s channel is being impersonated, please visit our reporting tool.
Impersonation of an individual – A user creates a channel or video using another individual’s real name, image, or other personal information to deceive people into thinking they are someone else on YouTube. If you feel that you are being impersonated, report it using our webform.
But impersonation does not include channels or videos pretending to represent a business. If instances of this occure, then aggrieved parties need to submit a legal complaint via an official legal reporting forms.
The changes matter if YouTube is to remain a platform for creativity and original content, argues Ariel Bardin, VP of Product Management at the firm:
For millions of creators, making videos on YouTube isn’t just a creative outlet, it’s a source of income. We set up the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) in 2007. Today, more creators are making a living on YouTube than ever before. However, with this growth we’ve started seeing cases of abuse where great, original content is re-uploaded by others who try to earn revenue from it.
To help protect creator revenue, we recently made it easy for anyone to report an impersonating channel. To date, this change has helped us terminate hundreds of thousands of channels violating our policies. Now, we’re taking another step to protect creators by updating the thresholds required to join the YouTube Partner Program.
Bardin added that YouTube wants to put in place measures to assist genuine content producers to hit the all important 10,000 mark:
If you’re a new creator who’s just started building your channel, our YouTube Creator Academy has tips on making great original content and growing your audience to help you get to 10,000 views and beyond. Once you’ve applied for YPP, you can check your application status in the Channel tab in Creator Studio, under Monetization. We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands.
My take
These are important changes that YouTube is maing, but inevitably the proactive action being taken here is going to be unfavorably compared to its alleged lethargy in tackling the problem of extremist groups picking up ad revenues, while also compromising the brands of key advertisers. The 10,000 limit isn’t going to be much help here – a number of the most extreme examples of content on YouTube have viewing figures in the hundreds of thousands tiers.
Analysts at Nomura Instinent estimate that Google parent Alphabet looks to lose $750 million this year from an advertiser boycott. That sounds a lot and like a fiscal wake-up call, but in fact it’s less than 1% of total projected sales for the year, so it’s not really something that will keep executives awake at night. The PR damage to YouTube’s own brand is still the thing that’s most likely to result in visibly more-proactive action.
