The analytics world, and the closely linked database market, are changing at an incredible pace – spurred by the opportunities customers are seeing in mass-storage and analysis of all types of data. Although plenty of enterprises are still running their batch analytics overnight and continue to use their SQL databases, we are seeing more and more companies dipping their toes into new methods and experimenting with new technologies.
Businesses are beginning to realise that unless they can get to those insights quicker and adapt their strategies before their competitors, they will likely lose out down the line.
Which is why when we hear of interesting vendors, with interesting customers, that are getting some investment attention, we think it’s worth highlighting. Fuzzy Logix is one of those vendors. And although I hadn’t heard of the company until last week, when it mentioned some of its customers to me, I took note.
Unfortunately I can’t reference these customers just yet, but I can say that they include some of the biggest retail names in the UK and some top financial and healthcare organisations in the US.
Today Fuzzy Logix – which was started by two ex-investment bankers that saw an opportunity in the market – announced that it has received $5.5 million in Series A funding from New Science Ventures to support its business growth. Although the amount isn’t staggering, I took the opportunity to have a quick chat with co-founder and CEO Partha Sen.
Sen explained that the company is helping its customers drastically improve their performance and cut down on costs using its in-database software. He said:
We are basically a firm that provides software for high performance computing and big data. Everybody is talking about big data and it is true that things like the globalisation of the economy, the advancement in technologies, storage becoming very cheap, that folks are collecting very large amounts of data. Every 18 months enterprises are doubling the amount of data that they have stored. The question is, how do you take advantage of all that data? Obviously in order to take advantage of all the data we have stored, we need to perform analytics.
Conventional analytics tools are unable to overcome the challenges posed by big data. If you were to do analytics using conventional tools, first and foremost you are going to have to move the data from your warehouse into an analytics server. That is very time consuming. We have customers that were moving data for five days and then performing the analysis. The second challenge is that conventional analytics is not built for building 5,000 models, or 15,000 models. And that’s becoming a reality.
A retailer that sells on the web and wants to do forecasts, but also wants to do some sort of customer activity models for all their products. You could easily run into hundreds of thousands of models. In conventional analytics you would have to build these models one at a time. And that’s very time consuming. What we have done instead of moving the data to the analytics engines, we have actually embedded analytic engines into the database. We have written software that enables an analyst to perform any type of advanced analysis directly to the database.
 That rings true. Sen also gave examples of some customers and the benefits they are seeing. He said:
We had several early adopters and the reason why these adopters care is that they had some problems that they were unable to solve. Whether it is on account of scalability, where they cannot actually handle all of the data, or because of the performance. Several early adopters were unable to meet their SLAs and we were able to bring down timings from maybe 30 days to two days or one day. There was one case where the analysis was taking 20 hours and we brought it down to a few minutes.
Another example, we have one of the largest retailers in the UK doing modelling to forecast the sale of different products in different stores. With our software we have got it down to about 45 minutes. We are finding that our software brings 10X to 100X improvement in performance.
Growth
So what does Sen and Fuzzy Logix plan to spend its investment on? Like many other technology companies in the early stages of growth, Fuzzy Logix plans to use the money to fund marketing activities to help raise the profile of the technology in companies that it may not have had access to previously. Sen said:
We have closed a deal with New Science Ventures for an investment of $5.5 million in order to fund our growth and some of our future initiatives. This funding is going to propel a number of activities that we have been planning for a while. Those activities are for certain initiatives that will help our customers adopt the product faster, quicker. Those are in the space of Hadoop. We are actually building an advanced analytics suite on Hadoop, so that will get some acceleration. It will also help us increase our sales and marketing coverage.
[A key challenge is] educating people and changing their mindset about analytics to be done outside their preference of classic technologies. That is a change management issue, people don’t like to change. They’ve been working with existing technologies and existing methods for years.
Whilst it is true they have a lot of pain points, there is still a little bit of reluctance to actually change. So obviously marketing has to do a good job. We are going to be spending quite a bit of dollars in marketing to overcome that challenge.
Another key area that Sen is hoping to address is the issue of acquiring talent. As with many other companies in the industry, getting the right people to come on board (when there is a shortage in supply and plenty of demand), is a bit of an uphill struggle. But Fuzzy Logix is optimistic about its prospects. Sen said:
The biggest challenge is to find the technical resources and this has been very challenging to tell you the truth. First of all, good technical resources are always difficult to find. And we are sort of on the bleeding edge and doing things that are not taught in school and are not mainstream, so obviously we are actually looking for smart people with a background in analytics and making them go through a training process. That takes time.
I think that we are sort of handicapped a little bit in terms of resources because it takes time to bring those people on board. We are making progress on that front, but that will remain a challenge for a period of time.
My take
One to watch…
