diginomica hit: Workplace change – can employers keep pace? by Phil and Janine
quotage: “There seems to be a disconnect between what people see happening in their personal lives and what they expect to encounter at work. ADP warns that enterprises risks losing the support of employees if they don’t move faster, and I’m inclined to agree with that conclusion.? – Phil

myPOV: Phil and Janine tackled workplace tech from two angles this week. Phil examined an ADP-funded study with over 2,000 (mostly) white collar workers in 13 countries (Is workplace change fast enough? – new ADP study). Phil notes that the three most popular technology-enabled workplace changes – including virtual learning – were viewed positively by more than 80% of respondents, but “a much smaller number expected the change to impact them significantly at work.” Ergo: “Work structure changes will take longer, people believe — especially those that give them more autonomy and self-direction.”
In her examination of digital learning, Janine comes to similar conclusions (Learning & Development must learn from the business to succeed). The first step for learning and development professionals? Get more aligned with business objectives. As per Brandon Hall’s 2015 State of Learning & Development study, only 30 percent of companies say that their learning strategies are aligned to business goals. Build a new, shiny LMS if you want. But Janine advises a different approach.
diginomica four: my “top four” stories on diginomica this week

What it’s like to be a woman working in Silicon Valley – “One client asked me to sit on his lap” – Derek delivers a scorching take on a troubling new study, The Elephant in the Valley, which looks at the predicaments of women in Silicon Valley (thus the ‘sit on his lap” anecdote). As I said on Twitter, “It’s absurd we still have to talk about this but we do – it needs to be in the light and discussed.“
Data is the marketer’s greatest asset and biggest problem – Barb Mosher Zinck looks at the problem of data, which is: data collection is hardly the same as insight. Marketers want to get closer to customers, and data can help – but how? She assesses recent studies in search of fresh answers.
Irish Tax Institute finds NoSQL answer to taxing content challenges – Going schema-less is all the rage. But the reasons are more interesting than the trend itself. Jessica looks at ITI’s move to the MarkLogic NoSQL database, and why it’s proven superior for processing and exposing a vast array of third party content and documents.
Authoritarian versus libertarian – intractable privacy and security concerns between the Valley and Washington? – Kurt adds his voice to the encryption pieces on diginomica, arguing that the new back door push from Washington is a “ juicy vulnerability that will inevitably be reverse-engineered and exploited by hackers, cyber criminals and nation states.“

Vendor analysis, diginomica style – It was a “put Oracle and SAP cloud plays under the microscope” kind of week, with Stuart filing an exclusive on Oracle’s European cloud push (Oracle ramps up investment in Europe’s cloud – exclusive interview with EMEA chief Loïc Le Guisquet). Den saw good things in his first look at SAP’s Q4 2015 pre-announcement (digibyte – SAP blows out Q4 2015 in pre-announcement). Phil asked some hard questions about cloud earnings, and not just from SAP and Oracle (How real are SAP and Oracle’s cloud numbers?).
Phil took a personal look back at a Salesforce milestone in 10 years ago, what Benioff told me about AppExchange (hint: it’s about platforms). Phil also looked at Coupa’s fourth acquisition in a year (Coupa acquisition adds contract authoring to source-to-pay). Gist: “This is all part and parcel of its quest to bring together a range of source-to-pay processes.” Den saw a “surprisingly good outcome” in Infosys’ Q3 numbers (Infosys Q3 FY 2016 – a surprise with more to come), but Stuart has a mixed outlook for outsourcing bellwether TCS, which is grappling with a digital services transition (Digital is the way ahead for TCS as outsourcing giant reports flat third quarter).
Jon’s grab bag – Phil filed another intriguing piece of vendor analysis in If data’s so important, why is IBM selling Salary.com? (Short answer: “Think carefully before assuming that a large volume of data is inherently useful.” And: Stuart manages to pull some big picture lessons – err, make that scathing insights – from his own broadband woes in How can BT have spent so much on CRM, but still has no single customer view? “Left hand, right hand again. Or other opposing areas of the body” – did I hear a “blammo!”?
Best of the rest
 Technology and inequality – by Vinnie Mirchandani
quotage: “As Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y-Combinator (which has created quite a few millionaires with the startups it has funded) writes in his passionate essay “let’s attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth in the process. That’s much more likely to work than attacking wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.” –
myPOV: With Martin Luther King, Jr holiday in the U.S., I picked a piece on inequality from Vinnie Mirchandani. He is much more bullish on the power of robotics and automation to transform economies than I am. Doesn’t matter. What matters is having the conversation. And in Mirchandani’s case, he’s studied these trends enough to inform his optimism. I hope he’s right about technology providing an economic engine for reducing inequality.
It’s election year in the U.S. which means we can expect a heaping load of posturing bullshit on this topic and few meaningful conversations. So let’s tune out the political preening and keep this thread going.
Other standouts

Salesforce reboots Wave Analytics, reduces carbon, and woos analysts -It was a hectic week for Salesforce news, with announcements timed around an analyst “summit”. Doug Henschen hit the high points in Salesforce Reboots Wave Analytics, Preps IoT Cloud. Redux: “Salesforce is finally on target with Wave’s packaging, pricing and a tighter, clearer.” As for Salesforce Thunder and IoT Cloud, Henschen raises questions about real-time analytics needs – still to be addressed. Josh Greenbaum offered another take in Back to School Week at Salesforce.com, including user experience overhauls via the Lightning UX. Finally, Tom Raftery hands out carbon kudos in Salesforce on track to being the cloud CRM provider with the lowest carbon emissions.
Robots are pretty nice – even if they aren’t self-aware yet – Continuing with our feel-good robotic future, Kimberly Mok writes about “co-bots” in Collaborative Robots Will Help Human Workers, Not Replace Them, Co-bots are what they sound like – robotic assistants that help humans complete tasks (or that work in close proximity to humans). Check the embedded videos to see co-bots in action. Meantime, Adrian Bridgwater looks at the state of robotic self-awareness in When Self-Aware Computers Sense Human Life. Turns out scary Terminator-style self-awareness is nowhere near, but the next step – computers that are capable of sensing human presence – has some intriguing use cases, such as a “car seat belt vital sign monitor with the ability to wirelessly detect human vital signs continuously and in real-time, without contact.” Privacy be damned – that’s innovation 🙂
Big data out of the trough of disillusionment, but hairballs remain – Gil Press digested two big data surveys and boiled down the stats in Big Data: Rising In Importance But Still Challenging, New Surveys Say. Here’s some good news/bad news: 62.5% of firms have at least one instance of big data in production, up from 31.4% in 2013 and 48.2% in 2014. Only 5.4% of firms now report that they have no big data initiatives planned or underway. BUT: 42% of companies don’t have real-time analytics skills and 41% are lacking relational database skills. As a result of poor data management and usage, 29% suffer from inefficient decision-making and inability to reach new customer segments, while 38% suffer from wasted time.

Honorable mention – lots of good ‘un this week, forced myself to narrow to seven:
8 Questions to Evaluate the Resiliency of Business Transformation Program – credible, field-tested tips, such as identifying project blind spots – though I could do without the blatant sales pitch at the end…
A Bitcoin Believer’s Crisis of Faith – newsfeed readers liked this story of an ecosystem implosion and the lessons it implies. As one of my readers said, “developers make kings, but they also slay them.”
How To Break Through The Noise With Human Content – very few executives have figured out to to blog with openness/humanity. Those that do have an edge.
SAP SuccessFactors Professional Certification Level: What it means for customers and consultants – a definitive piece from last week.
Michael Coté, Pivotal: What Does It Mean to Be Cloud Native? (podcast) – a good example of quality sponsored content.
When Do We Win (in Technology Sales – Sales may be changing, but there are still winner and losers. The problem is that “winning” extends far beyond the deal close now.
Customer 360 in the Cognitive World – If “cognitive” can resolve my tech support issues count me in!
Whiffs
So Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw Wasn’t Supposed to End Up With Mr. Big. Hey, no big deal – just a total violation of the show’s subversive/unsettling premise, that women can find happiness/identity outside of marriage. Sounds like a classic case of “too many chefs” leading to watered-down-corporate-product. Now I’m having flashbacks to the last time I got a Word Doc with red marker “input” from every member of a marketing department… No chance of catching “Sex and the City” on Netflix, or many other shows now that Netflix is going lock-down on international VPNs (will the backlash against this move hurt them in the long run? I’m betting yes.)
Just in time to avoid further accusations of censorship during election season, Twitter has Reversed its Ban on Tracking Politicians’ Deleted Tweets. This isn’t about opening the API to all, but it IS about solving an issue that was hurting political accountability, whatever is left of it.
Finally, I like db-engines.com and their database ranking. I also have no doubt that Oracle is a worthy winner of DBMS of the year. Their explanation of the blurring of the lines between relational databases and NoSQL rings true. But let’s be clear: this is a popularity contest that may or may not offer actual market insight. For example, if you look at the January RDBMS rankings, holding tight in the number nine spot is “SAP Adaptive Server,” commonly formerly known as Sybase ASE. If it’s in that spot two years from now, I’ll turn in my guru card. Oops I don’t have one anyhow.
SAP’s much-trumpeted SAP HANA database checks in at the number 21 spot. This may be a reality check for HANA marketing, but it also indicates why popularity is an important metric – but not the only one. You can’t tell from these rankings that SAP has banked its future on SAP HANA. But it’s an important fact to know, eh? Even the best data needs framing-with-context. As for popularity, as Billy Squier will tell you – it’s a fickle thing indeed.
