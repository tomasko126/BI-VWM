The world has been changed by Brexit and for a period the future will be more uncertain.
It’s a variant on the ‘nobody knows what’s going to happen’ meme that’s characterised almost every element of British life since the 23 June Brexit decision was announced.
This time it’s coming from Baroness Lucy Neville-Rolfe, UK Minister for Data Protection, and it’s in relation to a matter of considerable interest/concern to US cloud services providers – what will the data protection regime be post-Brexit? And how will that impact on doing business in the UK and the European Union (EU)?
The answer, according to Neville-Rolfe is that she doesn’t know, any more than anyone else does, admitting:
I will have to be less definite today about the detailed UK line on many things than I would have been a short while ago.
What she does know is that data and therefore data protection does matter to citizens and as such needs to be a priority agenda item, although often viewed through the wrong lens:
[Data protection issues] have been seen first and foremost as technology or IT issues. But data protection can be viewed through a different lens. On this view ‘data’ represent people, individuals with personal lives, reputations, and livelihoods increasingly enmeshed with the technology we rely on through the data they share. If organizations misuse or lose this data they are breaching not only people’s rights, they are invading their privacy. They risk damaging people’s wellbeing not just data sets.
In the correspondence I receive as a Minister, people don’t talk about breaches and technology failures, they talk about their distress, fear, anger and an erosion of trust. Technology shouldn’t therefore be the starting point for a response. ‘Protection’ should be about respect for individuals and the personal information they share in good faith. That should shift the focus in the board room from a technical issue to a reputational and commercial one.
The elephant in the room is the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which take effect across the 28 members states on 25 May 2018. With the candidates to succeed David Cameron as Prime Minister all talking down the prospects of Article 50, the legislation that needs to be set in motion to meet Brexit’s two-year notice period, being triggered this year, it’s more likely than not that the UK will become subject to GDPR before it can quit the EU.
As Neville-Rolfe positions it:
One problem is that we do not know how closely the UK will be involved with the EU system in future. On one hand if the UK remains within the single market EU rules on data might continue to apply fully in the UK. On other scenarios we will need to replace all EU rules with national ones. Currently it seems unlikely we will know the answer to these questions before the withdrawal negotiations get under way.
Until recently my main focus in matters digital was on the impact of the EU Data Protection Regulation. As matters stood, and perhaps still stand, it was expected to take effect in the UK by 25 May 2018. In line with what I said earlier we – all of us – need to consider carefully what might be done either to replace it if and when it ceases to have effect or, instead, if in the event it never comes into force.
But there are some things that can be taken for read and that is that there will be need to be a way to assess adequacy of data protection if any country wants to share data with EU member states. This will be a key consideration in the Brexit negoations, says Neville-Rolfe.
Shields raised
The other elephant in the room is the need for a Safe Harbor replacement, AKA as the so-called Privacy Shield. Again, it’s uncertain what impact Brexit will have here, but as the EU and the US have yet to agree a final text or indeed what the scope of Privacy Shield and how it will work, that’s a moot point perhaps. Neville-Rolfe says:
Throughout the negotiations, the UK Government has been urging both the Commission and the US to conclude negotiations on this new legally robust adequacy decision, in order to provide clarity to the businesses that transfer data from the EU to the US, and to reassure citizens that their rights will be upheld in the new agreement. All of our discussions with the Commission and the US have recognised the need to strike the balance between commercial interests and fundamental rights.
Neville-Rolfe explains that there will be more to say in the government’s digital strategy, but that it “would be imprudent” to forecast its exact timing. But in uncertain times, she urges a need to “unleash economic dynamism” to counter any Brexit downturn. This includes tapping into the Internet of Things as a booster for the economy:
If political events were less exciting I could have waxed lyrical and long about the Internet of Things, how we are going to see exponential growth of ordinary objects and devices connected to the internet. Many of these devices are already on the market and in time nearly all products and services will have a digital element. This is a huge opportunity for Britain at home and overseas with its strength in digital, its creative, innovative people and strong universities to keep up the flow of new ideas and IP.
Her conclusion is simple:
To quote the Chinese proverb we ‘live in interesting times’. The essentials are I suggest first, that the explosive growth in digital developments of all kinds will continue apace and second that the need to protect citizens’ interests and data will remain a priority. But how we achieve the latter objective has got a little more difficult.
My take
A lucid exploration of the data protection and data transfer limbo in which the UK – and Europe – finds itself in. No answers, but lots of questions. A very Brexit-situation. But this is an area in which the government needs to get its party-line sorted out fast.
