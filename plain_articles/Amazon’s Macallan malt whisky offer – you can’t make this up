Amazon is advertising a 50 year old anniversary Macallan whisky for the princely sum of £57,750. There’s no indication of how many bottles were made available but if you want one then at time of writing there is only one left in stock.
You’d maybe expect to see something like this on eBay but Amazon? The doyen of digital commerce? What makes this particular offer all the more fun and up there with the Christmas tradition are the comments.
They’re interesting because said whiskey is not scheduled to arrive at buyer’s chosen location before December 28th.

Or how about this?

 
Some had sympathy with the delivery charges:

There’s a couple of conclusions here.
One is that this was posted as an April Fool’s joke back in April and the ‘crowd’ is starting to catch up although occasional comments have been dribbling in for months.
Another is that Amazon has no real product comment moderation going on. That would not surprise me because the flip side of this is the rob0-conversation I recently had with Amazon’s Audible system. I’ll get to that another day except to say that when you have an amount appearing on your credit card statement that you cannot tie to an Amazon Audible account then Amazon cannot track down where the payment is being applied. Catch-22?  You bet.
It’s nearly the end of 2016 folks and it has been one heck of a year across multiple dimensions. Here’s to hoping that 2017 will see more amazing Amazon offers while it make a better job of roboticizing itself.
In the meantime, I wonder if Jeff Bezos, CEO Amazon might wish to pick up that last bottle, making it as a peace offering with Donald Trump? Just saying….
