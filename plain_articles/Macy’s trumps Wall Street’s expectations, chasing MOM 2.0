Not something you see nowadays
Over the past few quarters, US retail chain Macy’s has been on the receiving end of some decidedly un-Presidential gloating from Donald Trump about its poor performance. (They fell out over his comments about Hispanic immigrants.)
Yesterday as the retailer turned in full year sales down 2.5% year-on-year in 2015, Trump renewed his call for a consumer boycott of the firm as not having the best interests of the USA at heart, taking time out from the Republican Party caucus in Nevada to do so. 
But despite the crucial fourth quarter holiday season sales being down 5% year-on-year, Macy’s stock was actually on the rise yesterday, indicative perhaps of how low Wall Street’s expectations were for the firm. 
According to Macy’s Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet, the focus now is on:


growing what we might call our core omni-channel business.

That’s going to mean investing more in key areas: 

The largest increases would be, in terms of the growth initiatives, would be in digital. That business continues to grow very rapidly. We not only need to invest in supporting that sales growth, but also looking forward, particularly, as I said earlier, on mobile. So I think there’s a lot of investment being made in digital growth, which, by the way, is not all digital sales. Part of that is omni-channel investments, so the customers can easily go back and forth between stores and the Internet.

She adds: 

Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.

Offline/online
There’s still work to be done on the mobile front, she cautions: 

A lot of it has to do with the ease of shopping when you are on a mobile device, whether it be the mobile-enabled Web, or on our app. So things like a natural language search, we are looking to add different filters and facets, as you navigate, is a big one. [We are] also trying to, what we call, optimize the purchase funnel, things like adding bag to check out and all kinds of things that just cleans it up and makes it easier to use.

That’s important because customers use their mobile devices to browse, which in turn drives footfall through the Macy’s real world front doors: 

As that becomes more important, how do we help customers get the information they need on their devices, whether it be product reviews, or even, in some cases, how to find their way through some of our bigger doors? So the better I think we make these mobile devices, the more we’re going to get the interaction between stores and online to help our business going forward.

Whether the mobile-savvy consumer shops differently once he or she is inside the store is unclear, adds Hoguet: 

Some do, some don’t. It depends. There’s a lot of talk about people shopping and being more purposeful when they come in the store. Others are still doing sort of the old-fashioned shopping that we used to do, and often then going home and buying online. So there really isn’t one answer. But we do find that, in our categories, having the store is a huge advantage, whether it be to check a color, check a size, spend an afternoon with your friends and shop. Or going for a service experience: a makeover, for example, or a special appearance.

In fact, one interesting learning for Macy’s has been that online and offline performance is clearly linked. Hoguet explains: 

In dot com, typically we do worse when we close a store. This omni-channel behavior is very important for our customers, and if they don’t have the store to browse in or return to, they often don’t shop as much on macys.com. So that’s an offset in terms of the retention we get from closing the stores.

In other words, the Macy’s offline real estate is an asset in the war against the likes of Amazon. Hoguet confirms that this is pitched as a competitive differentiator: 

A lot of it is the store base and having the ability for customers to interact with us in different ways. The second, I think is our talent in the whole fashion arena, from picking, editing the assortments, presenting it, and the vendor relationships. I think that is a huge competitive advantage to date, vis-à-vis, Amazon. But I think it starts with the store base, and our understanding of the fashion customer, which is different.

At the heart of all this is MOM. That stands for MyMacy’s (aka personalisation), Omni-channel and Magic Connections (aka loyalty programs). It’s a clumsy – and frankly rather sexist – acronym. It’s almost as though someone in marketing thought the real issue facing Macy’s was not enough ‘cute’ Three Letter Acronyms. 
But that said, MOM is here to stay and now heading for MOM 2.0, according to Hoguet: 

We are evolving the meaning of MOM to coincide with where the customer is heading.
MyMacy’s is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omni-channel today means providing omni choices for our customers in stores and digital, especially mobile. And Magic Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building Magic Connections with shoppers. 
Under these redefined MOM strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives. They are grouped into five buckets. One, acquire new customers and deepen loyalty. Two, win with distinctive product. Three, push the digital frontier. Four, expand through new formats. And five, create signature experiences.

My take
In the company’s official earnings release, CEO Terry Lundgren is quoted as stating: 

I have reminded my team that our setback last year is a setup for our comeback.

Which is a bold attempt at pitching the ‘glass half full’ argument that because we lost direction in the first place, we will be able to claim great progress when we get ourselves back to the position we were in to begin with.
Not sure that’s a message we’ll be hearing from Amazon anytime soon. 
Nor indeed from Macy’s bete noir, The Donald…
