Devin Wenig is a man who recognises that Monday morning’s going to be tough.
When PayPal starts independent trading, eBay’s market value is expected to drop from more than $75 billion to around $30b billion. (PayPal will be worth more than its current parent company at that point.)
CEO Designate Wenig is candid about the tough path ahead:
We’ve made solid progress, but we have a lot of work ahead of us to maximize eBay’s significant potential. We’re still feeling the effects of new buyer cohorts we did not acquire over the past year due to the SEO traffic issues, and we’re still working to recover buyers that we lost after last year’s cyber-security incident. To be clear, our absolute priority is to improve our competitiveness and drive more stable, profitable growth over the long term. We have a clear vision and strategy for our business.
Central to that strategy is a large dose of ‘sticking to what we know we can do well’, he says:
eBay was built on enabling unique selection and unmatched spectrum of value to our buyers around the world, and we plan to focus our resources and innovation on this large segment of the market. First, we’re building a more robust commerce platform. Second, we’re enhancing our engagement with the core buyer and seller segments, who create a vibrant marketplace. And third, we’re creating exceptional product and brand experiences.
The enhanced e-commerce platform is a long-term vision, he admits, but work has begun. For example, from this month sellers need to provide product identifiers when listing items. This will enable eBay to introduce better browsing and product searchable pages. Wenig explains:
So far we’ve launched hundreds of thousands of new browse pages into the SEO ecosystem and early results show that these pages convert equal to or better than the pages that they’re replacing. We’ve launched thousands of new product pages across 22 categories through last week. These pages are the seeds of our ability to showcase our offering across new, refurbished, and used items, and provide the consumers the ability to make value-based choices that are truly unique to eBay.
More channels
There will also be an increased focus on social channels, still a relatively small part of the eBay route to and from market. Wenig says:
We view social media and messaging platforms as a great way to reach our customers in the places they love, while allowing us to diversify our sources of traffic and user acquisition for consistent long-term growth.
On Facebook, we’re early adopters of dynamic product ads, which enable retargeting on mobile. And on Pinterest, eBay’s inspirational shopping content is driving very high engagement and click-through rates. And this success has positioned us as the top advertiser on the platform.We’re also focused on growing our newer channels including Instagram and Tumblr and we’ve recently launched efforts on Snapchat and Periscope.
This diversification of channels is important, he argues:
The majority of eBay’s traffic comes directly to us either to our apps or to our site, that’s the premium of our brand showing up. But not an insignificant minority comes through channels and it’s very important that we have more of those channels that are competing for our dollar. We’re working very closely with the social and the messaging platforms to try to scale our investment to healthily – at positive ROI of acquired new users and new traffic.
In terms of the eBay marketplace, Wenig says that sellers in it represent 70% of the total number of global retailers, with plans to reach out to more.
As for the brand and customer experience, recent additions have included enhancements to iPhone, iPad and Android platforms and the addition of an Apple Watch app. Coming up next is what Wenig calls “a new experience” across mobile channels:
This experience is built upon learnings from our iPad app, a more engaging discovery-based experience for buyers that also builds on our simplified mobile selling experience. This release will unify the mobile experience across our platforms and it’ll enable a consistent user experience and faster product iteration.
Marketing spend
There will also be some increases in marketing spend, particularly around the holiday season, but Wenig plans to be conservative in his approach:
In line with what we normally do on holiday, we will ramp up our holiday spend. It’s likely that, depending on the underlying metrics that we see, we may do that a little bit more aggressively this season.
But let’s keep in mind that we are a very disciplined marketer. We don’t throw money against the wall and hope things stick. We measure almost every penny that we spend and we try to get a return on that. It doesn’t have to be immediate, but we understand the customer value of user acquisition and we’re disciplined about the way we spend.
Mobile eBay
Underlying his thinking is a simple maxim:
It’s not hard to grow an e-commerce company; it is hard to grow value in an e-commerce company and we’re solving the grow value.
So we will spend into the holiday, but we won’t spend to acquire business or users at any cost, because plenty are doing that, but not plenty are creating value.
As eBay begins the next phase of its existence, it’s also celebrating its 20th anniversary. That gives Wenig and his team pause for thought:
We’re making rapid changes to position this business for the future. My goal and that of the entire leadership team is for eBay to be the best global marketplace and a great enduring Internet business. eBay was founded with a purpose-driven ethos, which has fuelled our company and our brand.
As we write the next chapter for this incredible business, we will continue to focus on our purpose to empower people and create opportunity through connected commerce.
