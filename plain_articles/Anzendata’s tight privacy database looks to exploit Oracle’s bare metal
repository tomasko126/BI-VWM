Working with data about people, lots and lots of people, can be an extremely useful tool for many areas of business stretching well beyond the obvious candidates of sales and marketing departments.
But working with people data inevitably comes down to working with information about real people – who they are, what they are about, where they live, their bank account details, all those trivial bits and pieces they would rather keep to themselves than have them spread around the world.
The standard answer to this problem is to use anonymization techniques to remove the personal details of individuals. But even this does not go far enough to satisfy some regulatory bodies, especially when it comes to storing and working on data generated in Europe, in some other place such as the USA. Anonymization is just not legally substantial enough to allow users to store such data.
A different approach to the problem has recently emerged, however, in the form of UK company Anzendata. This popped out of the woodwork at the recent Oracle Code event, which was all about getting developers working with the rapidly expanding Oracle Cloud services. Despite not using Oracle databases or applications, Anzendata is an Oracle customer, having selected the Cloud Platform as its delivery system of choice.
When it started, seven years ago, the company set out to create a technology that could store such data using Amazon’s AWS services to store UK financial information. But, as Anzendata CTO, Gary Mawdsley, soon realised, AWS at the time only operated the United States so a way had to be found to encode the information such that it could be stored offshore:
We didn’t want to not use AWS because of the constraints put on us by the UK Government and the EU, so we created a scheme. I was attending a Cloud Security Alliance conference and met someone from an international privacy law firm where I learned why we weren’t able to store on AWS. Even encryption is not sufficient to adhere to the law. So we don’t simply anonymise in the Anzen model, we looked to hide data inside data.
Privacy by cluster
Anzendata now claims to produce a database that stores information and treats information very differently from any other database product available. Instead of having people define the structure of the data upfront as the application is being conceived, theirs has a machine learning element that understands for itself the structure of the information it contains.
This does mean giving it something of a heads up to start with. During configuration, users give it a clue to the things that would allow it to better understand the clusters of information that live inside the database. As an example, he uses London’s Waterloo Station at rush hour, where there is a crowd of perhaps 10,000 people. But when you analyse them all down there are perhaps only 15 to 25 types of people on that platform:
What I mean by that is that a group of them are travelling a set distance outside of London. They are either renting or have a mortgage and they have properties that are roughly the same square meterage. They are drinking the same beer and watching the same TV programmes. Yet all of our information systems are recording all of the same information all of the time for all of the people. But there were only 25 people on that platform. So why are we recording all of the information all of the time? But we don’t lose information, we will still retain all of the information specific to a person in the context of the group. This allows us to distil the essence of those people out of the bulk of the data.”
The Anzen system is primarily targeted at people-oriented applications, which does encompass quite a wide scope, from sales and marketing through to financial services and healthcare.   As an example, Mawdsley uses an independent financial advisor who would direct the tool to cluster on the types of financial plan and their values, in combination. This would allow the advisor to filter out the people, by their types of holding, as clusters that can be detected in the data. From these, deltas can be created those pieces of data which are the deviation of, say, mortgage value of the individual from the average in the cluster to which they have been assigned.
To get the best results does mean that users need to have a good understanding of who or what they think represents their potential marketplace, i.e.:  what individual or what characteristic represents it? Mawdsley explains:
So there’s number of points there really. The Anzen database doesn’t really understand the data with any other goal than protecting the privacy of the information. But there are a number of side effects with our approach. One side effect is that we’ve reduced the bit rate of the data stored so potentially the volumes of the datastore is significantly reduced and UCL are mathematically formalize what’s helping.
A direct benefit of this is that because the data loses the key aspects of its attachment to a real person, users can offer up the bulk of that data to their own market research companies or other organisations to discover patterns in the data which are useful for sales generations.
Enjoying Oracle baring its metal
As well as having a novel approach to data privacy in databases, Anzendata is also novel in being a Oracle Cloud Platform customer while not being an Oracle customer per se. It has rapidly been assumed that the core market for Oracle’s cloud services is the large base of on-premise users of Oracle legacy databases and applications. So to find a non-user as a customer seems out of the ordinary.
In practice, however, it may well be just one of the first of a growing army of non-Oracle using customers for the company’s cloud services. The reason is in fact quite straight forward. The majority of Oracle customers will be facing the data privacy issues that Anzendata is setting out to resolve and remove. There is, therefore, a fair degree of both push and pull in action by Oracle welcoming them on-board.
Having the company available on its cloud service could be just the pull for existing on-premise users to make the move to the cloud themselves. It may also `push’ other players in the wider Oracle ecosystem to consider being available on the cloud service as well, potentially creating even more of a pull.
And with Oracle now having over 50 cloud datacentres around the world means that users can access and work just about anywhere in the world with data from anywhere else in the world, and move data and results between regional offices. Mawdsley sees this impacting areas such as global decision making on research and business activities.
The other key lever in Anzendata going with Oracle’s cloud is not just its global reach but also its performance, and in particular its Bare Metal Cloud services:
We have people who place their service in certain geographies in order to get that microsecond advantage on trade. As Anzen re-fragments and disperses this data, we too have the problem of being able to bring this information together in real time in an OLTP situation. Because of the way we restructure and split the information the three shards that we create have relatively different volumes and so we can use caching technologies in the jurisdictions in which the data is being assembled to mitigate issues with latency. We believe with our approach corporate data is safer in the Cloud because we are fragmenting, splitting and then re assembling. It’s safer in the cloud than it is on premise.
On the Oracle Bare Metal Cloud we have more room for manoeuvre because of the speeds of those networks. We are still investigating speeds and drawing comparisons. But the evidence so far is that the architecture, engineering and the response we are seeing leads us to believe we are going to be more likely to succeed on Oracle than we are on AWS.
That said, the company still intends to be running on all three clouds AWS, Oracle Bare Metal and Microsoft Azure, though it has not yet ventured onto the latter.
My take
Time will be the judge of the efficacy of the Azendata solution to working with people-related data in an environment of high data privacy, but its appearance on the Oracle Cloud Platform, as a service that is likely to interest many existing Oracle users. And with its bare metal services pitching at providing high performance and low latency services, Oracle may have hit on a useful co-dependency between itself, its vast army of existing users and its ecosystem of smaller vendors providing specialised services. This could, indeed, create a service environment that attracts new users to the Oracle fold.
