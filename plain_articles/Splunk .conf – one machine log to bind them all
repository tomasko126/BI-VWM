Splunk may have started life as an IT Ops business, but it in pretty short order it added a strong element of security capability to its repertoire. After all, the best way to spot that something malicious is happening – rather than has happened – is to spot its appearance in the machine logs.
It has taken longer for the next step to be taken, but the signs are all there that the company is now working on taking it – becoming a BizOps business.
The early signs of this – a big push to implement and integrate machine learning capabilities and the appearance from Splunk partner, Insight Engines, of a natural language query tool that works with Splunk’s Search Process Language – could be seen at the company’s annual .conf event held in Washington DC.
CEO Doug Merritt’s opening keynote, contained some indirect references to the trend as he told the 7,000-plus delegates about business related use cases such as The Global Emancipation Network, a collective of techies aiming to use their skills and Splunk analytics tools to find ways of countering human trafficking, the State of Louisiana, and which is using Splunk to save $70 million a year in IT infrastructure costs.
There was, however, little direct reference to more business-related applications in an event where the devoutly technical audience were avidly lapping up information on new enhancements to the company’s analytics and security tools.
Merritt also told the audience how Splunk is making its tools easier to scale and use, as well as announcing a new ‘Centre of Excellence’ model where users will be able to go online for help, advice and support. This will include newly introduced Best Practice Guides, Splunk-validated architectures, proactive support, and a new Splunk Connect Portal through which users can connect to gain access to this information and support on a 24×7 basis, and at no cost.
Machine Learning from IT Ops to Biz Ops
This is where the developments in machine learning and, to a lesser extent, AI, made their appearance, though primarily as tools to make systems and security management easier. While such tools will have an obvious impact on areas such as security, providing capabilities such as learning what constitutes `wrong’ operations and ensuring they are reported and trapped, but also what constitutes operational best practices – the `right’ things that need to be done – and ensuring they are correctly applied.
The company has devoted a good deal of effort to expanding its range of machine learning capabilities across much of its product portfolio, with particular focus on Enterprise 7.0, IT Service Intelligence Version 3.0, User Behavior Analytics 4.0 and updates to Splunk Cloud. There was also an updated suite of solutions applying analytics and machine learning to fraud and cloud monitoring.
Richard Campione, the company’s chief product officer, told the audience that machine learning is now seen as critical to both the company’s and its customers’ evolution as it pitches at opening up machine learning capabilities to every user. Here, however, a hint of the Biz Ops direction for the company could be seen in his remarks, such as this one:
Data is a strategic advantage and organisations are looking for the fastest, most efficient way to turn data into answers.
More and more the answers will be directly business-related as the lines between IT Ops, Security Ops and Biz Ops fade and merge. An example of this could be seen in the John Lewis customer use case session, which demonstrated the growing overlap between the ops management issues of the `sorting out something going wrong’ department and the business management issues of  ‘Is there some more that we can do right?’ department.
This can even be just at the level of where in the business process something wrong is happening – for example a failure at the checkout stage is more directly, and measurably, painful than a drop out by a `tyre-kicker’ just browsing a website. When, as with John Lewis, the `something wrong’ was caused by specific circumstances causing an absence of a `right’, the relationship between IT, security and business ops becomes almost a singularity.  (A deeper dive into the John Lewis experience with Splunk will follow later. )
Analyzing the one log that binds them
And as all such good/bad, malicious/benign events show themselves for analysis and identification in the machine logs of each computer, this does put Splunk into a strong position as the lingua franca that can join events in IT and security directly to events in business management and decision making. Indeed, logs have the distinct advantage of being agnostic to all computer languages, so queries in the Search Process Language, might well unearth related incidents that have occurred in different applications written using different languages.
Machine learning capabilities have been enhanced or added to a wide range of Splunk’s tools and products. Both Enterprise 7.0 and Splunk Cloud have been enhanced and both are said to allow to predict future IT, security and business outcomes through integrated machine learning techniques.
It also announced new machine learning capabilities for its existing packaged solutions. For example, the latest ITSI Version 3.0 now combines service context with machine learning to help identify both existing and potential issues and prioritize remedial actions, while the new UBA 4.0 UBA has a new software development kit designed to allow customers to create and load their own machine learning models to identify custom anomalies and threats.
There is also now a Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit, available free to any customer, which is intended to help them build tools and applications that help operations and business management teams predict future outcomes. This includes machine learning model management, which integrates user permissions via user interface, public machine learning APIs for open source and proprietary algorithms, and a data prep module to help customers prepare and clean their data.
The company has also expanded its customer information services with the Enterprise Security Content Update service, a new subscription service that offers pre-packaged security content to Splunk ES customers. Security Essentials for Fraud Detection is another free service – an app that guides customers on how to identify and investigate different types of fraud, including healthcare, payment card and transactional fraud.
It is also producing a range of Insight services, for Amazon AWS cloud users and those concerned about ransomware attacks.
My take
Another technology provider moves towards the business operations and management arena, though in this case Splunk does seem to have one significant advantage – the fact that machine logs lie at the heart of everything in the IT world. Its ability to analyse those logs puts it in the position where it can build operational bridges between IT operations, the implementation/imposition of security, and the impact on business decision making. And the greater use of machine learning and AI could see actions being initiated and implemented across all three areas simultaneously from the prompting of one logged event.
