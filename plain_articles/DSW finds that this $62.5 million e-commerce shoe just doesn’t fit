When looking to expand into new markets or business models, there’s usually a straightforward choice – organic growth or entry by acquisition.
The former takes time, but does mean your corporate culture can evolve; the latter is quicker, but can result in integration challenges that distract or actively harm the business.
A case in point is US shoe retailer DSW and its push to build out e-commerce capabilities as part of an omni-channel strategy.
In pursuit of this ambition, it made sense to management to splash out $62.5 million on purchasing an e-commerce company called Ebuys, a fulfilment business that sold discounted shoes on third-party marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay.
That was two years ago. Yesterday DSW announced that in fact this had been a mistake and that its was shuttering Ebuys and liquidating the inventory.
It wasn’t entirely a surprise. Last November DSW had to write down the value of Ebuys by $52.7 million. Something wasn’t working, although at the time CEO Roger Rawlins stated that Ebuys was a long game that:
provides valuable expertise to manage end-of-season clearance through online marketplaces. The successful integration of this business will unlock future synergies across our brand portfolio.
Not any more. So what went wrong? According to CFO Jared Poff:
The challenge of sourcing the right merchandise in a sustainable way and the requirements to scale the business entail unacceptable economics in the near-term. We are in the process of liquidating Ebuys remaining inventories and winding down its operations and expect to complete this process by mid-2018.
The party line of course is that while this adventure in e-commerce has failed, DSW has learned from the mistakes and will come away as a more adept digital vendor. Poff argues:
Although we are disappointed by this outcome, our brief ownership has given us enormous insight into online marketplaces which will inform future potential decisions around leveraging our industry-leading digital platforms to compete with traditional retail and direct-to-consumer models.
Digital fit
It is true that the termination of the Ebuys gambit doesn’t mean that DSW has abandoned its digital ambitions. Far from it, says Poff, pointing to the firm’s own online successes:
Our digital business smashed previous records this holiday [season], including our biggest ever CyberMonday. Our redesigned website continues to boost customer conversions, particularly on mobile devices where our digital traffic is growing the most…transaction activity on our mobile app increased with 1.5 million downloads and close to 5x more monthly active users during its first year. Data shows that multi-channel engagement drive significantly greater spend and we will leverage DSW seamless digital experience to stay top of mind.
And it is an omni-channel play, with DSW physical real estate playing a critical role, he explains:
Our warehouse network played a critical role in fulfilling the surge in online demand this holiday [season] with local warehouses going over 40% of digital demand this quarter. Customers love the increased convenience of shopping online while having the product ready for trial and pick up at one of our warehouses.
For 2018, as well as the Ebuy inventory liquidation, a priority is to upgrade the in-store customer experience, says CEO Rawlins:
Customers today are willing to embrace new retailers to provide a relevant value proposition, and by creating unique customer experiences DSW will continue to inspire emotional loyalty among our customers. We’ve made several strides in innovation this year which we brought to market…with a new store design bringing a dramatic expansion of its assortment and new services, like shoe repair a nail salon services.
The robust customer response we’re getting from these initial tests proves we’re tapping an unmet need. We’re expanding shoe repair to more stores and will debut a new service concierge where customers can avail themselves of these and a variety of services like order pickup, returns and exchanges at a central location.
We’re also working to develop a technology platform that will further speed up associate engagement with a future Point of Sale system that will integrate our inventory rewards and operational databases on a seamless mobile interface. We expect to pilot this technology this year.
All of this omni-channel investment will, reckons Rawlins, help DSW to reach out to new customers:
When we look at the GenZ, the Millennial, the GenX, the boomers, how all of those folks play out, we are heavily penetrating market share to the boomers and so finding ways to acquire new customers, especially as people come and go in our industry, that’s where we have an incredible opportunity. We have a great platform that we can use to attract new people to our brand.
Which leads to a rallying cry of:
It’s time for us to play offense and not just defense.
My take
Not every e-commerce gambit is going to work. See also Nordstrom and Trunk Club, for example.
DSW has paid for its mistake, but in reality the business is doing relatively well, even if its most recent quarterly profits were down year-on-year from $30.5 million to $11.7 million. Total revenue grew 6.7% to $720.0 million.
Clearly there’s a PR spin around the ‘useful learnings’ aspect of the Ebuys, but again there almost certainly are things to take away from the past two years, if the company genuinely wants to do so. And DSW continues to do good work with the likes of Infor, so there’s no reason for digital despair.
The main learning for other retailers though is surely, just because it’s an e-commerce acquisition doesn’t mean it’s going to fit your operating model. Impulse buys seldom work out for the best when you get them home…
