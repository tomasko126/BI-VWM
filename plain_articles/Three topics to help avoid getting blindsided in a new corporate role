I was talking with a team the other day about the first 100 days in an IT leadership role – they were asking about where to focus your attention and plan to attack the opportunity. Obviously, there is no one right answer that is applicable everywhere, but I was able to provide some structure and perspective.
My answer assumes the role is not a CxO position but a mid-level management function in a new company and industry and that the individual taking on the role has management experience in their background. Much of the following is applicable in any case, but the nuances would be different.
Attention focus points
People – The direct reports probably need to be first, since this is management and not an individual performer role. Understanding the needs, wants and desires of your people is a significant motivator in itself. It is also necessary to look for their best interests since they may not see the forest for the trees. What areas do they excel? Which areas need to be developed? Where do you as manager need to buffer them from distractions that keep them from doing their best? Developing a working relationship with direct reports needs to be at the top of the list to address.
Business – Who is your customer (internal and external) and what are their expectations, needs to be addressed quickly. What needs to be changed? What needs to be kept? Developing these relationships quickly is critical to early success. Your leadership should have a clear vision of why they needed you. Understanding that need is important – after all they are the ones who will be giving your performance review. From my perspective, one of the greatest sins a new manager can perform is to not listen to the unique situation they have been brought in to address and instead try to solve the problems of their previous job. I have seen that happen over and over again. It may work for a while but eventually you’ll get caught – you need to listen.
Process – Finally, when you are brought into a new industry or even a new company the processes will be different from that with which you are familiar. They are different for a reason. Finding out what those processes are and how things should function (for you as a manager) is critical. Do not allow some strange clerical idiosyncrasy to derail you unnecessarily. The processes will be outside your context. Don’t be caught unaware – ask for help.
Merging all these elements together is the culture and community of the organization, after all culture eats strategy for lunch. Internalizing (or at least understanding) the values and principles of the organization is important. Get plugged in.
In short, it gets down to three initial areas of focus and three activities in each one:

Stop/listen – don’t assume
Ask – they’ve probably thought about the situation more than you have
Prioritize and take action – you’re a leader, it is kind of expected

This was a short guide to on-boarding that I came up with off-the-cuff. What did I miss? See what I did there… I asked for help. You can always fall back on the old joke that is unfortunately all too true.
Three envelopes
A new leader came in to ask advice from the manager he was going to replace. The old manager handed him three envelopes and said, “My best advice is included, but only open an envelope when the situations gets really bad and you don’t know what to do.”
The new leader took the three envelopes and started work content in the knowledge that he had options ‘in the can’. Things went along great until about three weeks in. Suddenly, there was a crisis that he’d never experienced before. He was blindsided and didn’t know how to resolve the situation. So he reached into his drawer and pulled out Envelope #1. When he read the single sheet enclosed it said, “Blame it on the previous manager”. With that in mind, he knew just how to propose a solution and it was quickly successful.
Things went on well for about three more months, when suddenly he was again confronted with a problem he didn’t know how his organization could tackle. He pulled out Envelope #2. Inside was a single sheet with a single word, “Reorganize”. What a great idea, with this seed in mind a new organizational structure started to grow that could actually address the situation they were in.
Finally, about six months later another crisis arose. He was desperate and didn’t want to use the last gem of advice needlessly but with nowhere else to turn he opened his final envelope. This final, single sheet of guidance stated: “Buy three envelopes.” 🙂
