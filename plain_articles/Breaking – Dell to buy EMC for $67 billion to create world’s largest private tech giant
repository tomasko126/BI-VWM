Michael Dell
The biggest “privately-controlled, integrated technology company” in the industry.
That’s what we’re looking at following the confirmation that Dell is to take over EMC for the princely sum of $67 billion.
That money’s coming from from Dell CEO Michael Dell, MSD Partners, Silver Lake and Temasek, among others with Dell and his partners left owning 70% of the resulting conjoined company.
EMC will have a “go-shop” provision that allows it to pimp itself around the market in case there’s a better deal to be struck. This also gives EMC a discounted breakup fee if it does find another suitor.
The announcement brings to an end weeks of scuttlebutt and speculation, but leaves huge questions in its wake. Dell himself will be CEO of the new outfit, while EMC’s head honcho Joe Tucci will be sticking around at least until the deal closes.
Dell’s now doing the rounds of the media outlets, telling CNBC:
We’re creating an unbelievable powerhouse of an enterprise company. This is really all about bringing together complementary technologies and helping our customers address the challenges and opportunities that this digital future is creating.
Lots more to come on this during the day – we’ll be updating as we go.
