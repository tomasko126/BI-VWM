Today we celebrate diginomica’s second birthday. We’ve come a long way in those two years.
From our original crew of five, we’ve expanded our line-up to create a global team of 11 contributors with an average industry experience of 30 years, enabling us to deliver top-level enterprise analysis and commentary to something around 100,000 readers each month. We have more contributors to being on board and are constantly looking for deeply experienced talent, especially in the US.
Our roster of industry partners has expanded dramatically and today we welcome the latest member of that line-up, Infosys, the first pure-play services company to come on board with diginomica.
Enterprise services is going through a a dramatic transition and we want to be in the forefront of discussing the challenges and opportunities that presents.
Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka says:
At Infosys we think about renewal of what you already know as a way to release creativity for the new things you want to achieve. I’m delighted that we are partnering with diginomica who are taking the best of an existing media model and transforming that into something fresh and new. That thinking and approach aligns directly with our vision for the digital enterprise.
For which kind words, we thank him – and look forward to working with Infosys leadership going forward.
We have big #evilplans plans for our third year as we continue to make a dent in the enterprise software and services universe.
Thanks to all our readers who support and help us suck less every day. We could not have done it without you and we are keenly aware there is more, much more, to be done.
As for the rest and to steal the title from a song by Bachman Turner Overdrive “You ain’t seen nothing yet!”
