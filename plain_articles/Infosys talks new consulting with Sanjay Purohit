As I have said before, Infosys is transforming itself from being the archetypal ‘Indian body shop’ into one that adds value at its core. How well is that working? Check into this brief conversation with Sanjay Purohit, EVP and board member who talks exclusively to diginomica about what is happening and how that’s working out with clients:

In this conversation, Purohit was cautious to ensure that we don’t get too excited about the results Infosys expects to achieve.  A good move in my opinion given that outcomes are almost never easy to see in the short term.
Away from the recording, Purohit talked enthusiastically about the value achieved by clients. Numbers that start at $200 million were common. I pressed him to name customers but that is not something Infosys is comfortable doing right now. As you listen to the recording, it becomes apparent that value is not instant but delivered with purpose.
I will press Purohit to go deeper later in the year. In the meantime, enjoy listening to how Infosys is changing from being the low cost body shop to becoming the strategic advisor.
Disclosure: Infosys is a diginomica premier partner at time of writing and is a personal client.
