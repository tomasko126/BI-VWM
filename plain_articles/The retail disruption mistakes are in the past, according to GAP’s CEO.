I’m a realist. I can see where we have made mistakes.
Given the weak performance of GAP in recent years, that’s an important concession on the part of CEO Art Peck, but one he clearly felt able to afford given that the retailer just turned in its first quarter of growth since he returned to the hot seat two years ago.
Of course, the usual provisos kick in here about not being able to boast that the worst is over on the back of one quarter, particularly one where the overall corporate top line has been bolstered by one brand, in this case Old Navy. Banana Republic is still in a lot of bother – the firm has closed down all its UK branches and retreated to the domestic homeland – while GAP itself is still in need of some TLC.
But Peck argues that he’s taking a realistic worldview of the company’s fortunes, particularly in the need to invest more in omni-channel capabilities to counter the wider disruption in the fashion marketplace:
When I took over two years ago, that’s two years that has flown by, we knew our performance wasn’t where it needed to be. We knew that we were in an industry that was changing dramatically. Looking back on it now, I think we probably all underestimated the magnitude and speed of the changes taking place. It’s been pretty stark what’s been happening over the last year..some competitors have exited the market.
Size is going to matter here, he adds, as is brand awareness, although that didn’t help American Apparel as it slid out of business. Nonetheless Peck insists:
The market is – and we have clear evidence of this – continuing to move towards rewarding size and scale, whether that’s vendor relationships that provide favorable pricing and innovation, whether it’s us with a multi-brand portfolio doing business with our landlords to optimize our real estate footprint, or frankly whether it’s our balance sheet and income statement where we see scale in investments, whether it’s technology, innovation or other forms. But this is a market that is moving towards rewarding size and scale, and we believe that conveys us a significant structural advantage.
Mention of technology brings the conversation around to omni-channel capabilities. This is somewhere that GAP needs to play catch-up. Peck says:
Omni [is] almost a cliché word at this point because it isn’t like omni is in the future. Our customers are omni today and that is a fundamental reality. Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands on their phone and they finish it in our stores. Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands in our stores and they finish it on their phone. We’ve been doing work and we will continue to do work to really line up with where our customers are, not where they’re going but where they are today. I’m pleased with the progress, but we have more work to do.
This said, technology spending at GAP is below its own five year average of around $660 million. While some disruptors in other industries, such as Uber, argue that everyone is now a technology firm in a digital economy, Peck takes a different line:
We are a product company and we are a retailer. If we don’t get our product right, we will not win regardless of how good we are in digital or many other things. It starts with emotional product that she [the consumer] connects to, that has the right quality, the right fit and the right value proposition.
Two years ago when I got into this seat, we really approached product in two ways. One was some quick fixes, particularly addressing quality, aesthetic, the value and the fit and some longer term work that we’ve been doing where we’ve made significant progress.
Spending on the back-end
Of the tech spend that is budgeted, there’s been work on back-office functionality, fixing the supply-chain and resource management. Peck explains:
In GAP brand, which is leading the way, we’re moving to a demand-based buying model. This requires tools that are different than what we’ve historically used. Historically the tools that we use to merchandise, to do inventory management, to do sourcing and costing, there were 18 separate tools that we were using to do that. Needless to say, some of them were on green screens and many of them didn’t integrate.
We have moved now to one platform that can be used across all inventory, pricing, assortment building and in-season management and we’re well underway for the implementation of that platform in the company. That conveys, obviously, a productivity advantage, which is important for our cost structure. Most importantly, we believe that it really helps us to get the right product in the right place at the right time, to improve the outcome for our customers and to improve the productivity of all of our inventory.
It all comes back to product again and to that critical customer experience with those products. Peck elaborates:
When I say experience, it’s both the digital experience and the physical experience and, really importantly, it’s where digital and physical come together.
We believe that as a multi-brand portfolio, we have a structural opportunity to exploit some places for experience that we have not exploited historically. Today, we have a loyalty program that is single tender and connected to our credit card. We are in the process right now of building out a multi-tender multi-brand loyalty program that will deliver a rich, mobile-delivered experience for our customer.
We believe, and we’ve actually seen results that support this, that a program like this can drive higher share of wallet, higher engagement, increased personalization and also really offer us very efficient, very effective direct communication with our customers. It’s a path towards cost efficient marketing and engagement versus broad-based advertising. We think it’s a win-win. We’re in the middle of it now.
Work had also been done on shaking off the restrictions of GAP’s existing Point of Sale (PoS) technology, says Peck:
We, as much of the industry have, traditionally operated with a point-of-sale system that is hardwired terminal based in our stores. We’re largely complete in moving our PoS off of hardware into the cloud and making it browser-based. What this does is it obviously gives us efficiency in the back-end in terms of IT, but the most important thing it does is it puts capabilities in the hands of our sales associates and our customers on the floor that were never there before.
If you go back to Old Navy, what you see is a really exceptional sales-over-traffic spread. Not insignificantly, this was driven by the fact that we have deployed across many Old Navy stores the mobile PoS which also has the ability to do stock checks, to do check inventory levels, to open credit cards, etc. What we’re seeing is when a sales associate has this, it changes fundamentally the way they interact with our customers in a very positive way.
It’s all progress, concludes Peck, albeit perhaps not proceeding to date with as much pace as some market watchers would have liked:
This is a journey. It’s one that we’re approaching with urgency, with determination. I’m a realist. I can see where we have made mistakes, and I can see where I can get very excited as the proof points begin to materialize. My money is on GAP, not only to survive this changing environment that we’re in, but to emerge a very clear winner.
My take
A feature of every trip to the US for me used to be a visit to Banana Republic and a massive credit card-creaking shopping spree. This would inevitably result in the shop assistant commenting that British people seemed to spend a lot of money in the store, to which the equally inevitable retort would be, ‘Well, if you’d open some stores in the UK, we wouldn’t have to!’. Those stores did open a few years back to my delight and then ignominiously closed down earlier this year as GAP consolidated in the US. I can still shop via the Banana Republic web site and will gauge whether Peck’s confidence is justified by how long I’m still able to do that.
