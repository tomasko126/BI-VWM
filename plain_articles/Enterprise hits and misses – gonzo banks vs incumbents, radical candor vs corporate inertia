diginomica hit: Gonzo banks versus ‘technologically bankrupt’ incumbents by Phil Wainewright
quotage: “Incumbent banks in the UK have now reached such a crisis point in their technical debt, according to the young CEO of a challenger bank. Just as it’s become imperative for them to refactor their IT systems for the digital age, they’ve been forced to retrench.”
myPOV: If you’ve struggled with your bank’s archaic procedures, predicting their downfall is tempting: big banks are about to be Ubered and Lyfted into obsolescence. But banks aren’t taxis. Bringing a highly technical new term, “gonzo banks,” to the discussion, Phil takes the position that the big banks, once threatened by lack of capital reserves in the 2008 crash, are now facing the obstacle of technical and process debt. Driving the point home with upstart UK Bank Monzo, Phil argues that the so-called “digital transformation” of banks are mostly skin-deep projects.
But will big banks be pushed aside by agile newcomers? As Phil notes, the IT industry suggests otherwise: “The incumbents will either use their inertia capital to pay down their technical debt — or, more likely, they’ll buy up the successful challengers once they’ve reached sufficient scale.” In an earlier piece, HSBC – banking at the speed of digital while carrying a snail’s shell, Paul Wallbank provides something of a counterpoint, taking an upbeat view of HSBC’s digital endeavors, as in reducing customer friction with machine learning and automation (“no paper, no passwords)”. Phil takes a guarded view, noting that “You won’t hear much about investment in replacing core systems with a new generation of digital technology.”
Bingo – customer-facing window dressing is not digital transformation. Nor is digital just a cost-cutting hedge trimmer. As in my Starbucks Friday Roast, if you don’t address the whole enchilada, you’ll wind up with the fugly-channel.
diginomica three: my top three stories on diginomica this week:

Lands End’s Amazon digital retail alliance owes more to Sears-xit than Brexit – Stuart catches Lands End with its hands in the blame-it-on-Brexit cookie jar. You can’t slip a retail earnings miss with weak Brexit sauce past Stuart. Try it – you’ll earn a review of your retail botches instead. “Sears-xit,” on the other hand, is a serious predicament. But all is not lost for Lands End – Stuart’s eyeing their aggressive Amazon play.
The robots are coming and we’re all royally screwed – Den scored enough robotics fodder from BoxWorks for a huge cup of Joe. In other words, pour your beverage first, blow off your email, and dig in. One thing that bugs me about the robotics vs jobs debate: too many key voices are dug in, stuck in ideological rigidity. Den looks to push through that in this piece, parsing clashing viewpoints and pushing for economic depth. A vigorous comment thread rounds out your morning.
New processors in the cloud accelerate AI and big data – Phil strikes again, with a review of the vendor moves provoked by the processing demands of AI and big data. After his run down of Intel, IBM and Google, Phil concludes: “Suddenly, it’s become important for enterprise IT buyers to pay attention to processor architectures in ways they probably haven’t since the 1990s.”

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. Here’s my three top choices from our vendor coverage:

BoxWorks 2016 day 1 – the good, the bad and the ugly – Den found a surprising amount of worthwhile content in an unexpectedly meaty BoxWorks. He followed the day one roller coaster with analysis of Box’s workflow-focused IBM collaboration, BoxRelay, Will Boxing clever with BoxRelay knock out Adobe and OpenText? Den: “If the solution achieves the ease of use Box and IBM are claiming then I sense BoxRelay will have solved an age old problem that continues to cause friction inside the enterprise.” I expected Den to hate BoxWorks – but that’s why we have to keep our editorial narratives at arm’s length, and give vendors the rope room to surprise us.
Buying Apigee will test Google’s enterprise ambitions – Phil filed a (relatively) upbeat take on an acquisition I wasn’t expecting. Phil warns that Google still has a lot to prove to enterprises: “But whatever its product strategy turns out to be, the vendor can still mess this up by how it handles its enterprise customers. Its track record in supporting on-premise enterprise products is sparse and undistinguished.” Yeah, this might be an enterprise boost for Google, if I’m an Apigee customer, I now have a whole new set of concerns.

A few more vendor picks, without the quips:

Airbus subsidiary to pilot 3D printing to new heights with SAP – Jessica
VMware innovates on its platform – but do customers care? – Kurt
Rule Britannia #2 – Microsoft claims UK public sector cloud data center first alongside MoD – Stuart

Jon’s grab bag – Derek goes after darlings of disruption airbnb with a gut check they certainly deserve in Airbnb finally makes changes to platform to tackle racism problem – is it enough? (Answer: probably not, but we’ll keep an eye). Stuart’s got a biting twist to the women-in-tech doldrums: Women board directors might be fewer than men, but they’re more tech-savvy (and that matters!)
Or, as Stuart said in his inimitable prose (yes, that’s a compliment): “So much for boys and their toys.” But Stuart’s not done with you yet, as the blame-Brexit earnings game gets one-upped stateside by don’t-blame-Amazon, blame…. Clinton and Trump? (Has Barnes & Noble been trumped by Amazon or by Donald Trump?).
Best of the rest
 On Receiving (and Truly Hearing) Radical Candor – by Firstround.com
quotage: “For Scott, it’s the time one of her colleagues called her on her penchant to fire off emails without thinking through the consequences. For a while, she’d dash off terse notes for expediency, not realizing they caused massive anxiety for their recipients. Until one day she got a note back: “You’re awfully fast to hit send, Kim.”
“That stung, but he was exactly right,” she says.
myPOV: For all the AI/automation talk, it’s the relationships between humans that need the most work. That’s true in a business context, where the “radical candor” needed to change behavior is too often overlooked in favor of the political schmoozing necessary to grip the ladder. This First Round piece on Radical Candor looks at how you actually turn candor into a management style. That means going in-depth into how managers can help create candor by openly sharing their mistakes and calling BS on themselves.
How’s this for a shift in outlook: “Treat the first people who freely criticize you like gold“. Yeah, I can think of some companies that have work to do to sniff that kind of environment. But I was impressed to read about CEOs like Michelle Peruso who email their own performance reviews to the entire company. Or this:
At Google, Scott used to ask her reports who criticized her privately to restate their thoughts in public meetings.
I had two problems with this otherwise strong piece. I get why the consulting firm in question, Candor, Inc., might want to trademark their Radical Candor phrase. But when you trademark every term in the quadrant, such as Ruinous Empathy, Obnoxious Aggression and Manipulative Insincerity, it feels like we are having a branded conversation. Yuck.
The authors of this piece (not credited) did a poor job of addressing the problem of Radical Candor in multi-cultural settings. There are some cultures where such candor could be taken as a personal affront, and you could lose the cooperation of that person or team. Those nuances are sorely lacking here.
No other pieces get the “standout” writeup this week – get busy blogging people! But here’s a run through some honorable mentions:

Box Event Report – Box BoxWorks – Box is on the run – now with a platform – Complete with Holger Mueller and Alan Lepofsky’s seat-of-pants wonderfully spontaneous video-in-the-car redux.
Software waste tab $34 billion in U.S., U.K., says report – A rare thing in our industry: a vendor list you DON’T want to be on – the users-are-indifferent-to-your-shelfware list.
The confusing terminology around AI – “Intelligence comes from the brilliance of the designers – not really “artificial” .
Reflections on Six Years of Content Marketing in a Bootstrapped Startup – Brutally practical, totally unsexy – and yet it works. Punching above your weight with content for the win…
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Spins Off Non-Core Software Assets to Micro Focus – You have nine days to read this unspectacular-but-newsy update before it goes behind a client wall.
What’s the organizing principle of today’s digital workplace? – I found this piece dense, but there are useful nuggets in how to frame digital pursuits.
Beyond the iPhone – Fanboyish, but at least it’s erudite and tries to think beyond corners, in this case, a future without… phones?

Whiffs
As expected, there were a slew of 9/11 anniversary-related whiffs – gaffes which did the rest of us a favor by identifying the crassiest, soulrottiest people now scrounging amongst us, including this ill-fated mattress store in Texas that literally put itself out of business in one twenty second spot.
Journalists were all over Facebook for censoring this iconic Vietnam war protest photo. But I can see Facebook’s plight with its struggle to define, at scale, how this type of photo differs from child pornography. Where Facebook went off the rails was deleting feedback/suspending accounts that hurt their bunny feelings. What’s the opposite of radical candor? “Feedback Weenies” perhaps? (is that trademarked?). I thought Facebook’s biggest whiff of the week was this one anyhow:

“Facebook Pulls Its 9/11 Trending Topic After It Promotes A Hoax” https://t.co/t4Wnc4hkVv -> algo fail – maybe rehire the human editors? 🙂

If nutjobs can so easily defeat Facebook’s algorithm what does that say about the state of “machine learning”? Then there is all the spin-doctoring of Apple’s flatlined iPhone announcement:

“Apple’s Strategy Is Innovation By A Thousand Tweaks” https://t.co/R6b8zyYAcO -> fanboy much?
— Jon Reed (@jonerp) September 10, 2016
Ben Thompson’s piece, which also had a fanboy aroma, at least tried to look around a few corners and float the notion that by getting rid of the headphone jack, Apple is nudging us toward a world beyond phones. One fallout I can guarantee: lots more Taylor Swift on planes as people crank their iPhones, having forgotten/not charged their bluetooth headphones.
Apple doesn’t care about that; they are too busy “innovating,” or, as Buzzfeed puts it, “smart little evolutionary changes.” Nahhh – I’ll save my kudos for a company that’s willing to fail big while attacking monster problems. I don’t begrudge Apple their post-Steve-Jobs business model. Heck, I’ve lauded their self-serving but important encryption stance. Still, it would be lovely if the media that covered them made a distinction between “innovations” that make the world better for all, and those that ease leisure class friction, like making Bluetooth pairing a little easier. Hoorah, consider me jazzed.
But I guess you don’t have to stress about innovation when even your mundane decision to tidy up your app store evidently warrants extensive media coverage. As for phones, they’re gonna be around until Siri can have a rewarding conversation with my hearing-impaired mother. Over to you, Clive.
