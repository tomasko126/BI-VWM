Lead story – Jim Snabe, Chairman of Siemens, on Dreams, Details, and navigating uncertain times – interview with Den Howlett

MyPOV: For years now, we’ve looked to Jim Snabe as a leader who inspires while remaining practical – and open to dialogue. Den picks up the dialogue again in this follow-on to themes in Snabe’s book Dreams and Details. When was the last time you heard a Chairman say something like this?
We are so used as leaders to believing in the plan but we don’t account for change. In the current world that no longer makes sense. The plan is meaningless and so I believe that to release the kind of creativity and human potential required to succeed then you have to free people from the plan.
But as Den says, there is more method than madness here. Snabe again:
I believe you can only successfully concentrate on one or two things that you’re working upon in an iterative, scrum session way to eventually achieve perfection. I want to get that one thing perfect.
Den raises questions and critiques of the book, before concluding:
Applying scrum principles to figuring out how to approach the details of the future allows for experimentation and a degree of failure while at the same time learning.
And if we limit scrum to a technical delivery model, we’re limiting ourselves:
The principles of learning when the pathway to the goal may be unclear can hold good across multiple industries.
Waterfalls are still lovely to look at but maybe not to live by – not anymore.
Diginomica picks – my top three stories on diginomica this week

Lessons learned on accessibility, inclusion and diversity at RedMonk’s Monki Gras – listen up and take action – RedMonk is pushing hard to make tech events more inclusive. Gosh knows there is work to do there for all of us. Derek got a first hand look, with this important takeaway: “Designing for everyone will result in a better service/product in the end.”
Integrators who don’t ‘integrate’ and other ERP problems – Brian Sommer has a thorny bouquet for lift-and-shifters systems “integrators” that transition to cloud (dis)services: “Too few ‘implementers’ are actually ‘integrators’ and frustrated software buyers aren’t liking this.”
Ralph Lauren combines ‘drop’ and digital to catch the streetwear Gen Z buyer – Don’t consign Ralph Lauren to the polo bins of history just yet. As Stuart analyzes, the iconic retailer has a few Gen Z/mobile tricks up its sleeve. Also see: my illustrated NRF rundown, The informal NRF demo awards – a countdown of retail tech in action.

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. Here’s my top choices from our vendor coverage:

Levelling the gig economy playing field – the Worksome perspective – Can AI and machine learning make the gig economy more equitable? Consider me doubtful, but Martin’s not a bandwagon jumper. If he thinks Worksome’s freelancer – employer matching is worth a look, I’ll listen.
Exclusive – Condé Nast on the pursuit of customer experience at web scale, with DataStax Enterprise – Instead of handing me an editorial tranquilizer press release embargo, which would have found the circular file in the sky, DataStax offered me a customer use case to break news. Done.

A few more vendor picks, without the quotables:

New Relic takes on notifications overload problem with SignifAI buy – Stuart
Why Texas Scenic Company is pursuing construction in the cloud with Acumatica ERP – Jon
The Telegraph moves its cloud ‘crown jewels’ to Google – Phil

Jon’s grab bag – The Guardian just open-sourced robotic news production tools, leading Den to ponder, Will robotic news production help or hinder? Meantime, Den rolls on with a terrific installment in the diginomica podcast series, this time bending the ear of another victim recruiting MarketWatch transparency reporter Francine McKenna (cool job title). Catch his writeup: Can you trust the seasonal earnings release?
Speaking of making a semblance of sense from earning reports, Kurt gives it a good crack in Insights on cloud growth from AWS and Microsoft latest earnings. Neil gives an analytical pep talk to the transformation laggards and vig takers persistent insurance industry in The US insurance industry needs rebooting – here’s why.
Finally, Jerry has a big data redemption story in Can data make the world a better place? The Data Science for Social Impact Collaborative thinks so. Or, I should say, story-in-the-making, but the data-science-for-public-good mission sounds good.
Best of the rest
 My top enterprise picks this week:


Ultimate Software Sells for $11 Billion – I know what you’re thinking – isn’t an $11 billion acquisition lead story status? Ordinarily yes, except there aren’t any terrific stories on this yet, and the tarmac is calling my name. But this Workforce.com story points to reasons why an HR company on a growth trajectory might go private. More room for R&D spend without quarterly earnings pressure for one.
AI Adoption Challenges – 12 Lessons From The Trenches – AI practitioner/skeptic/enthusiast (yep, it’s possible to be all three, as long as you monitor your Koolaid levels) Vijay Vijayasankar of IBM assesses reasons for slower-than-expected AI adoption. Vijayasankar stops marketers hot air balloons in hand in their tracks with: “Pardon me for saying this – but anyone who says things like ‘use AI to re-imagine xyz’ should be stopped and questioned on specifics before allowing to continue their pitches.”
Big companies are not becoming data-driven fast enough – TechCrunch’s Ron Miller takes a break from the news stories for a think piece that goes well with Vijayasankar’s missive. The tools to manage and parse data are getting shinier and speedier by the day, but: “The data suggests that it’s not a technology problem, it’s a people problem.” It’s a data integration/quality problem too, though. Every data silo takes ten IQ points from your “AI.”

Honorable mention

Supply Chain 2019 Predictions: More SCM Software Vendor Perspectives – I’m not a predictions buff. The only prediction sure to come true is predictions-going-wrong (see: Snabe and uncertainty above), but – I like what TEC’s PJ Jakovljevic is up to in his series, polling multiple vendors and pulling it in one narrative. The tensions between agility and efficiency, and planning versus execution, are worth a ponder.
Digital Transformation, IT, and the Rest of the Company – the role of IT in transformation efforts – especially customer-facing projects – is worthy debate. One surprise for The New Stack: containers, microservices and edge networking are not cited as key digital transformation drivers by the majority in this particular research. People > techno-wizardry.
Keeping Attention – Substance Over Style – Gartner’s Hank Barnes goes Devo, pushing against the marketing push to be cool. Somewhere on the flat circle of space/time, Philip Seymour Hoffman is smiling. Granted I’m trying to give you both here, but if I ever go heavy on the garlic at the expense of the steak, I’m sure you’ll let me know. Deal?
Facebook’s Tool for Automated Testing at 2 Billion Users Scale – “We can learn from Facebook” is one of the least-typed phrases in the 5+ year history of diginomica, but, when it comes to getting your fix from the pusherman web scale, we can absolutely learn from Facebook.

Whiffs
Another rarely used phrase in hits/misses is “I agree with Jeff Bezos,” but I do seem to find myself on his side in his latest skirmish, though someone in my profession finds it natural to loathe the National Enquirer.
Anyhow, the facts are murky and contested, but with headlines like “Bezos exposes Pecker” (New York Post), the page views are mounting. (The Story Behind the Instant Classic “Bezos Exposes Pecker” Headline).
Some might find this a gratuitous slam – true. But I couldn’t resist:

Meanwhile, not sure if this is a whiff or just a scent of our delightful, connected future, but Amazon Recorded Video Of A Seller’s Face For Identification Purposes.
Our delightful, connected future part deux:

Finally, we learned this week that brands have feelings too. Glad folks are looking out for Sunny D (SunnyD Shared A Depressing Tweet, And People Are Concerned About Capitalism). Great to see people stepping up, encouraging SunnyD to hang in: “Every time you’ve wanted to give up you’ve gotten through it. You will get through this.” Just what I needed to hear also. See you next time…
If you find an #ensw piece that qualifies for hits and misses – in a good or bad way – let me know in the comments as Clive (almost) always does.
