With Prime Minister Theresa May finally confirming that we are likely heading for a ‘hard Brexit’, meaning that the UK will exit the single market in order to gain control of its borders, the business community is beginning to think through the implications for its various sectors.
Quick off the mark is techUK, a lobby group and membership organisation for the tech sector, which released a report this week analysing the importance of the sector to the UK economy and outlining what it believes to be the key priorities for European Union exit negotiations.
In its central London offices this week, techUK brought together a number of interested parties to discuss the findings.
Jacqueline de Rojas, managing director at Sage and president of techUK, took to the stage to announce the findings of the report, written by Frontier Economics, and to reiterate the importance of getting this right for tech and digital workers/companies. She said:
When you look at the UK technology and digital sectors, one key statistic to note is that this sector represents 16% of GVA, which is  both producing technology and using technology. So it’s significant in terms of how big that is in terms of productivity, for innovation, for export and for growth. It’s something that we can’t ignore.
In the tech sector we did have an overwhelming preference amongst our membership to remain in the EU. But following the public decision to leave, the tech community clearly respects that decision. Now it’s time to focus on ensuring the best possible outcome and best possible business conditions.
Digitally intensive sectors are highly integrated into Europe, both through trading of goods and through services. So the sharing of regulations, standards and specifically data is really critical as a focus for how we move forward. We are certainly calling for the smart movement of tech talent, which is different from open borders.
The tech sector is a successful sector. It is innovative. It is resilient. And it is not immune to Brexit.
Key takeaways
The report is very comprehensive, and long, and so we thought it would be good to collate some of the key findings here, which are worth the government considering when it enters into Brexit negotiations.

The ‘digital sector – a group of 12 industries that produce or intensively use digital goods, services, and labour in production – accounts for 16 percent of domestic output, 10 percent of employment, and 24 percent of exports.
On the supply side, half of inputs in production for the ‘digital producing’ segment are imported. Twenty percent of final demand of goods and services for the entire digital sector is exported, with many linkages to Europe.
The digital sector is primarily services: 96 percent of sector output and 81 percent of sector exports are spread across services activities. The report notes that tariffs on digital goods are broadly low and bounded by WTO rules. As a result, the main risks for the digital sector after Brexit will be non-tariff barriers, in particular for the regulation of services activities.
There is a reliance on global talent. Some 18 per cent of the sector’s 3 million workers are foreign-born. One third of those are from EU countries. Foreign born workers accounted for 45 percent of net employment growth between 2009 and 2015.
The UK is a global leader in cross-border data flows – accounting for 11.5 percent (three quarters are between the UK and EU countries). The report notes that Brexit places the value of cross-border data flows at risk by introducing uncertainty on EU data protection regulations.

One of the authors of the report Ian Hathaway, manager at Frontier Economics, highlighted at the event how connected digital businesses are in global supply chains. Because the digital sector sources a lot of inputs for its products internationally, this could impact the end price for consumers. Hathaway said:
We wanted to unpack global value chains and get an understanding of how connected digital businesses are with other businesses on the supply side – so purchase inputs – and on the demand side, so customers. Like many other businesses, digitally intensive industries are connected with many other businesses. They take inputs, those inputs can be sourced from UK or international suppliers, they mash that up with their human capital, and they turn that into outputs. Some of those outputs are consumed domestically, and some are consumed overseas.
Overall the digital producing sector has a very high share imports in production. About half of inputs from across the digital producing sectors are sourced from international suppliers. Compared with 28% for the economy as a whole. So any disruption to that supply chain, might have an impact on the cost structure of those businesses and have downstream effects for their customers.

To coincide with the release of the report, techUK also has released a list of priorities for the European Union exit negotiations. The plan notes that a disorderly Brexit would “significantly increase the risk of demand – and/or supply-side shocks that would negatively impact consumers. Therefore techUK recommends a smooth exit from the EU based on the following points:

A realistic and robust plan to ensure the UK’s digital industries can thrive post Brexit - Recognise the importance of the UK’s digital sectors and their exposure Brexit
– Work with the digital sectors to understand what it needs from a new Free Trade Agreement  - Prioritise a smooth transition from EU membership to an FTA
– Detailed planning for the walk away option (i.e. not transitioning to an FTA, falling back on WRO rules). WTO rules have traditionally not well addressed services. How would UK government support UK tech?
– Develop a plan to expand trade in digital tech focused on strategic new high growth markets
– Calibrate the Industrial Strategy and the delayed Digital Strategy to Brexit
Ensure continued market access and regulatory certainty
– Ensure maximum access to the Single Market for digital products and services
– Ensure leaving the Customs Union doesn’t leave UK trade bound up in red tape
 Set out a credible plan to ensure the UK remains open to the best international talent
– Confirm that EU citizens currently working in the UK will have the right to remain and work in the UK
– Set out plans for developing a new low friction smart immigration system
– Recognise the importance of UK firms being able to locate UK nationals to work in EU states
Ensure there is a robust legal process in place for cross border data transfers
– When the UK leaves the single market there will need to be a clear and robust legal basis to underpin cross—border data transfers between the UK and the EU. The best way of achieving this would be a data adequacy decision by the EU.

On this last point, Member of European Parliament and chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, Vicky Ford, said:
[Theresa May’s] signal that she wanted to keep elements of the single market, have a relationship with the customs union, leaves open doors for the conversation to develop. I see that speech as the UK setting broad ambitions and then kicking the ball back into the court of the other EU member states, to say: do you want to have this type of relationship? The type of relationship being – maximising the access to each other’s markets and wanting to have a new partnership.
There are an enormous amounts of risks and challenges. And one of them is going to be this debate about data. I would like to see an ongoing relationship with Europe that maximises the market access, which means keeping a lot of that regulatory operation. Data is an area where you get divergence, potentially quite quickly, because of the very different backgrounds and histories of many of the European countries and their belief in data privacy, which goes very much to their core.
I can see a very ongoing risk of divergence in data laws. And I do see a Europe after we have left, and it’s almost starting now, being more protectionist already. We need to try and make sure that Europe keeps open, focused and meeting the global debate on things like data.
My take
I’m impressed by the comprehensive nature of techUK’s report and its recommendations – it’s well worth reading both in full.But it is incredibly complex. And this is just considering the technology and digital sector – two of many stakeholders. It seems that talent and data are the most important considerations, but concerns around free trade agreements and regulation are going to present navigational difficulties
It’s a long old road ahead for the UK…
