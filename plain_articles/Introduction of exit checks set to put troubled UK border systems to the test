In fact, only last year a parliamentary committee revealed that the Home Office had asked Capita to check over 250,000 immigrant case records in 2012 and 2013, to establish where people were residing, but Capita had been unable to contact over 50,000 people listed.
The Home Office admitted that it had absolutely no idea where these 50,000 people were – they weren’t sure whether or not they had left the country voluntarily or whether they were staying in the UK illegally.
Thanks to a long history of inadequate IT and costly failed programmes, the government has been unable to track the location of foreign travellers coming in and out of the country for some time.
Which is why today’s announcement that the Home Office and the Border’s Agency have finally introduced exit checks for all passengers will be welcome news.
For many passengers, particularly those flying in and out of the country, little change will be noticed, given that the government has already largely been relying on the Advance Passenger information (API) that is provided by the airlines to the  Home Office, which is inputted by passengers prior to their flights.
However, where API cannot be provided – for example on rail and ferry journeys – carriers and ports will verify travel documents and collect data by checking or scanning passports or national identity cards.
The Minister for Security and Immigration James Brokenshire said:

It is right that we have an immigration system that is fair, that tackles illegal immigration and that clamps down on those who try to cheat the system by staying here when they have no right to do so.
Exit checks will provide us with vital information that confirms a person’s exit from the UK. The coalition Government committed to reintroducing them in 2010 and the Immigration Act 2014 put in place legislation which gave carrier and port staff the powers to carry out these checks.
Port and travel operators are experts in their business and know their customers best, which is why we’ve supported them to design and trial the systems for collecting data in a way that will minimise the impact on customers.

Who exactly has designed and built these new exit check systems remains unclear – I’ve put in a request to the Home Office to get the point clarified. I’m aware that the Home Office has a pretty strong digital team that has been working to rectifying the problems of the past, and I would assume that they have played a strong role in this, but it has not been confirmed by the government. I will update.
The UK government has had a string of problems with its border systems, dating back to the early 2000s. It was revealed by a parliamentary committee last year that the technology failings could end up costing the taxpayer up to £1 billion. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of the Public Accounts, upon the release of the report in October last year, said:

It is deeply worrying that the Home Office is not tracking those people whose applications have been rejected to ensure that they are removed from the UK.
At the end of 2013-14 there were over 175,000 people whose application to stay in the UK had been rejected, and they are placed into a migration refusal pool to await removal.
The number of such cases has not been reduced over time. Some may have left the UK voluntarily, but without exit checks it is almost impossible to know.
The failure of major IT projects designed to streamline process not only leaves the Department reliant on archaic systems but may also end up costing the taxpayer up to £1 billion. The cancellation of the Immigration Case Work programme and the e-Borders IT programme could mean a gobsmackingly awful figure being wasted.
The Home Office must put in place skilled, incentivised staff and sort out its data so it can crack the backlog and move people through the system. It must also go back to the drawing board and develop a comprehensive, system-wide IT strategy.
The pressure is on, and the Home Office must take urgent steps to sort out this immigration mess.

The government’s two previous borders IT projects – the e-borders system and Immigration Case Work system – have both been scrapped, at significant cost to the taxpayer, because they failed to deliver on what was expected.
The e-borders contract was cancelled in 2010, costing the government £259 million at the time, but this figure later rose to £483 million after the supplier, Raytheon, successfully argued during an arbitration process that government officials had failed to execute the project effectively.
I have been told by those close to the situation in recent months that the Home Office is working hard to rectify the problems internally with its digital team, as it effectively had very few ways of verifying the flow of people in and out of the country. There has also been huge discontent about the performance of suppliers on the projects in the past, from those working in the department.
According to the BBC, the new exit checks and the systems are working well and have caused minimal disruption so far this morning. However, only 25% of passengers will be going through the process in the first month, with the aim of increasing to 100% verification by the middle of June.
My take
This has been an incredibly embarrassing and traumatic story for the Home Office. Immigration is one of the hot topics in the upcoming national election, but without effective systems in place, how can we manage the flow of people at all?
The new exit checks systems will go some way to rectify this problem, if they work as intended. I suspect many stakeholders will be expecting the worst.
I’m interested to know if the systems were developed in-house by the Home Office, because if they were, and they’re successful, it would be a huge win for government digital progress – a project completed by an in-house team that beats years of failed suppliers and contracts. That would be a success story, indeed.
