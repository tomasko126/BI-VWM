I’ve been a pretty fierce critic of Uber and some of its behavior in recent times, particularly in relation to women and in January to the homophobia allegedly demonstrated by one of its drivers in London, which led to other passengers reporting similar incidents.
Well, credit where it’s due, the firm has stepped up to the mark in Ireland today, where voters go to the polls to decide on whether to legalize same sex marriage in the country.
It’s a debate that’s divided the predominantly Catholic nation and while the polls currently indicate that the Yes vote will win out, it’s essential that supporters turn out at the polling stations if that’s to be the case.
With that in mind, Uber’s offering free rides to customers to those polling stations in the form of a €15 credit on the outward and return trips, valid between 7am and 10pm today.
Customers must enter the promotional code ‘Uber4Equality’ to get the offer which will then expire the following day. (If you’re voting no, you can presumably still use the same code and square that with your conscience.)
Kieran Hart, general manager of Uber in Dublin, says:
Uber is a passionate supporter of equal rights for everyone in our community. This is an opportunity to make history, which can only be achieved by getting people out to vote. We hope our free trips can help make a difference.
Details on how you can request your Uber to vote in Ireland today can be found here.
My take
Congratulations to Uber – and rival Hailo which has the same offer in place – for this gesture.
It doesn’t change my concerns about a lot of the company’s practices, but it’s a step in the right direction.
