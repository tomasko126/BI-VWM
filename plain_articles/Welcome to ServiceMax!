The first thoughts that led to creation of diginomica took shape during Dreamforce in San Francisco three years ago. So it’s appropriate that today, on the eve of this year’s conference, that we welcome ServiceMax as the latest member of the diginomica family.
We’ve been looking closely at the evolution of the service management space as it moves beyond traditional notions of field service and becomes a mainstream enterprise business application.
And we’ve kept an interested eye on what looks like the prospect of the service management wars, as ERP giants like Oracle shore up their arsenals.
On the front line of any outbreak of conflict will be ServiceMax, which has done much to (a) redefine perceptions of the service management sector and (b) set a high standard for rival vendors with a growing list of blue chip customer references, such as Sky Italia (present this week at Dreamforce).
We’re delighted to have ServiceMax join the ranks of our premier partners and look forward to carrying on the conversation about the future shape of service management.
For his part, ServiceMax CEO Dave Yarnold explains the firm’s decision to partner with diginomica:
The clarity and insight diginomica provides is unique in a landscape of noise. Their depth of analysis, strength of editorial independence, and enterprise-reach with buyers and influencers make diginomica a valuable partner. This is the future of digital publishing.
We’ll be catching up with Yarnold later this week at Dreamforce. Watch out for the first thought-leadership content coming from ServiceMax very soon.
