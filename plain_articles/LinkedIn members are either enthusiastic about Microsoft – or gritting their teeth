Last week marked a bit of a milestone in Microsoft’s Hannibal-Lecterization, err, I mean integration of LinkedIn. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who is – surprise surprise – an official LinkedIn Influencer, posted a blog with new roadmap details, Microsoft + LinkedIn: Beginning our Journey Together.
The reaction from 100+ LinkedIn members was an mix of ecstatic fanboys and snarky acquisition cynics, with a daunting PR gulf in between (didn’t see any fangirls in the comments but they are surely out there too).
Microsoft has to be feeling pretty good about LinkedIn. Now that the sticker shock is yesterday’s news, Microsoft can salivate over LinkedIn’s social graph, socializing Microsoft products, extending HR/recruitment functionality in their business apps, and perhaps even leveraging LinkedIn for Bing search if privacy hurdles can be overcome.
Happy talk aside, the LinkedIn user experience is probably not Microsoft’s biggest concern. Let’s face it: anyone who is still active on LinkedIn is active in spite of LinkedIn’s incessant promotions, marketing bullpucky, trivial endorsements, (overrated) influencer blog saturation, relentless emails, unwanted “reply to all” pimpstorms, irrelevant anniversary greetings, and pathetic levels of meaningful conversation compared to the stickiness of Facebook threads. It would be a real feat for Microsoft to dilute the caliber of conversation on LinkedIn further than the meager trickle of insights it generates now.
Before I get into the most memorable comments, note that earlier this week, my colleague Stuart Lauchlan updated on Microsoft’s EU success: Microsoft out to save the post-Trump, post-Brexit world as Europe nods through LinkedIn buy. Though Microsoft had to make some concessions for third party LinkedIn access, Nadella and team are surely feeling chuffed about one more hurdle cleared.
Microsoft – LinkedIn – short term roadmap details revealed
The short-term roadmap Nadella spelled out on LinkedIn included:

LinkedIn identity and network in Microsoft Outlook and the Office suite
LinkedIn notifications within the Windows action center
Enabling members drafting résumés in Word to update their profiles, and discover and apply to jobs on LinkedIn
Extending the reach of sponsored content across Microsoft properties
Enterprise LinkedIn Lookup powered by Active Directory and Office 365
LinkedIn Learning available across the Office 365 and Windows ecosystem
Developing a business news desk across our content ecosystem and MSN.com
Redefining social selling through the combination of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365

Some of these are mundane to the point of useless – who cares about getting LinkedIn notifications in one more portal? Others are about turning the entire Microsoft platform into a content bullhorn. The most interesting integrations – such as Office 365 plays – raise the privacy stakes by blending the personal and professional (while LinkedIn is a professional network, we don’t necessarily want our employers getting a ping every time we update our profile).
Microsoft and LinkedIn enthusiasts meet their match
The first commenters on Nadella’s post were pretty upbeat:

They weren’t the only happy ones. This Microsoft employee unloaded an epic synergistic string of buzzwords in his anticipation of a “best-in-class feedback loop engine”:

Others can’t wait to get airborne:

The commenters looking forward to the integrations weren’t very specific. The most popular was the prospect of Office 365 – LinkedIn tie ins. However, that also caused the first of the detractors:

Privacy concerns are front and center
Most of the detractors were inflamed by privacy issues. Though some comments are a bit over the top, it does show how surveillance and data breaches have undermined online trust:


These NSA broadsides are not out of thin air. In 2013, Microsoft gave the NSA access to encrypted messages. Though Microsoft was not part of the NSA email scanning tied to Yahoo this year, in 2015 Microsoft earned the ire of privacy advocates by acknowledging the so-called “auto-spying” back door in Windows 10 can’t be disabled (Microsoft claims that the aspects of data collection that can’t be turned off are important for monitoring their OS system performance).
Other privacy concerns were specifically tied to the use of LinkedIn data in Microsoft products. Given Microsoft’s Windows 10 approach, these folks are rightfully concerned:
This sounds awful, truly. Please at minimum make these features optional and off by default. Participation in a social network should not be a required part of my OS.
Another wrote:
Many of us would appreciate it if inclusion of our LinkedIn profile information in other users’ apps (Outlook, etc.) is an opt-in, not a must or an opt-out. Even better, have it be opt-in by LinkedIn contact. For example, I want John Smith to see my LinkedIn info associated with Outlook info and Jack Sprat to not see it.
Privacy comes down to nitty-gritty details. As this member wrote:
“Enterprise LinkedIn Lookup powered by Active Directory and Office 365” Does this mean that LinkedIn will access Active Directory? If so, how will that impact privacy concerns within organizations? If you purchase a LinkedIn premium license, will you know everyone’s contact information that utilizes Microsoft products?
LinkedIn ads and promotions are already an issue
Other critiques came back to my grouches. LinkedIn users are wary of wading through more spammy layers to get to the good stuff:

Another user expressed hope that by combining Bing and LinkedIn ads, LinkedIn advertising – more expensive than Facebook in most cases – would become more affordable. LinkedIn member Ali Kouhzadi implored Microsoft to “fix what is broken” in LinkedIn’s aggressive content push:
Sadly, LinkedIn has slowly become something like a weird mixture of BuzzFeed and everything that is wrong with Facebook! I can only hope that Microsoft is going to fix what is broken… at least partially! Can you please make that “Stories you can’t miss today on LinkedIn” thingy go away?! Make it optional, perhaps?!
Do I really have to read those articles with cringe-worthy click-baity titles every time I log into my account? Do I really have to read about “5 ways some dude did something he thinks is super rad and noteworthy, and it’s not what you think (YOU’D BE SURPRISED BY #3)”?! I swear this wasn’t a thing 1-2 years ago! Not sure what’s happened!
Finally, Nolan Povanesco reminds that the best way to view acquisitions is with an air of practical inevitability:

The wrap – concerns don’t alter LinkedIn’s potential
Despite the chip on my LinkedIn shoulder, I grant that LinkedIn has changed how we think about recruitment. It has become the de facto resume for job seekers in many regions.
Most of these commenters were likely typing on mobile phones; their shorthand probably doesn’t express the full context of their views. Still, the number of privacy-related concerns is notable – especially given that Nadella’s post and the comments on it are public. You have to assume that others with similar concerns were wary of posting.
Microsoft should be pleased by the passion of these comments, pro or con. But Microsoft needs to do a much better job than Nadella did in this post of explaining how privacy and data will be handled. That means a blow-by-blow, specific response for each roadmap item.
After reassuring LinkedIn members that the goal is to add value to all of them, Nadella ended his post with a big picture vision:
As Brad Smith recently shared, Microsoft – inclusive of LinkedIn – can take steps to help people develop new skills online, find new jobs and easily connect and collaborate with colleagues. Technology alone will not solve these challenges, but together, working across private and public sectors, we can create more opportunity for everyone to participate and share in economic growth.
If there’s an upside to this acquisition, it’s this. In a fluid and pressurized job economy, the portable value of our networks has never been more important. LinkedIn can do a lot more to make our best skills visible.
If Microsoft can find ways of expanding our networks in transparent ways, then that’s the upside. One thing we know for sure: this isn’t Skype. This won’t be a case of a purchase leading to disappointing neglect. Microsoft will be diving headlong into LinkedIn data. Whether that helps the rest of us remains to be seen.
