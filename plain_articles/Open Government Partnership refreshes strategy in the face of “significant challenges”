President Hollande, Open Government Partnership Summit
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) was founded by eight countries – including the US and the UK – back in 2011, with the aim of securing commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and use new technologies to strengthen governance.
Since 2011, the Partnership has increased from eight member countries to 70 and more than 2,5000 engagements have been upheld in 135 action plans.
The OGP’s annual summit kicked off in Paris this week, with France’s President François Hollande opening the proceedings. He said:
These are experiences we’d like to talk about. What digital technology has considerably changed, what the digitalisation of our societies has allowed in terms of expression and profound change in the relationship between the State and citizens.
You are here today, in Paris, to exchange, discuss, construct new coalitions, propose new tools, so that the relationship between public authorities and citizens can be changed, so that a new democracy can emerge.
A democracy in which the State, administration and public authorities can be open to every initiative, to every talent that would like to contribute. In which innovation can be present throughout, to improve public performance but also to encourage a real understanding of the actions of those who have received a mandate by the people to take decisions.
A change in direction
The summit also launched with the release of draft report by the OGP, announcing a strategic refresh for the group – driven by changes in the political and economic climate across the globe and an acknowledgement that not all of the actions taken by the group thus far have been successful.
The report notes how countries are experiencing competing global trends of shrinking or restricted civic space, increases in nationalist populism, a growing sense of citizen marginalisation, elite capture and a lack of trust in government. To add to these, uneven economic growth has led to fiscal constraints and many governments are struggling to provide services to the poorest people, said the OGP.
The OGP wants to shift its focus from top-level government commitments, to direct citizen gain from having an open government. The report states:
The principal drivers for the strategic refresh are the need to adapt and learn from the first two years of the current strategy, and to position OGP as a powerful countervailing force for openness in a geopolitical context marked by increasing citizen distrust in government, elite capture, marginalization, and shrinking civic space in many countries.
Over the next five years, OGP’s success will be measured not only by the increase in the number of countries or commitments but by the extent to which ordinary citizens benefit from governments becoming more transparent, participatory, responsive and accountable. This requires a greater focus on supporting government and civil society reformers’ efforts in OGP countries to build a national and global movement for open government, and ultimately demand reforms on issues they prioritize.
The strategic refresh will be followed by an implementation plan in 2017, which will outline concrete actions associated with each of the above priorities. This will be accompanied by a financing plan to ensure the goals laid out in this document can be realized.
What hasn’t worked
The OGP draft report – which will be finalised next week – talks quite openly about where the OGP has gone wrong with its work thus far. It notes that it is “facing significant challenges”. For example, it highlights:
• Inadequate ambition – The OGP recognises that it is quite good at securing high-level, public political commitment, but this has not necessarily translated into ambitious reforms at the country level. For example, only 17% of commitments are potentially transformative.
• Going beyond transparency reforms – A shift from transparency reforms to governments tackling the root of citizen distrust and elite capture, has not taken place at scale. It adds that too few commitments directly affect people’s lives.
• Scaling up learning to encourage ambition – The OGP recognises that establishing the rules, mechanisms and institutions to facilitate open government are not enough to produce ambitious reforms. It says that support to OGP reformers on OGP processes needs to be complemented by a renewed focus on implementing ambitious reforms on the ground.
• Working politically – Performance often depends on the incentives, resources and interests facing domestic political actors. Country level reformers need support to navigate the complex politics surrounding major reforms.
A new focus
OGP Summit
Having assessed what has worked and what hasn’t worked for the OGP to date, the report outlines a number of new priorities for the partnership going forward – which are focused on undertaking more transformative open government commitments, ensuring credible implementations and improving the lives of citizens.
The refreshed strategy will focus on the following:
• Deepen citizen-centred governance – OGP seeks to ensure genuine and inclusive co-creation in the organization, enabling citizens and civil society, including marginalized groups, to advocate of commitments that reflect the most pressing issues impacting citizens’ lives. For examples, issues could include , such as anti-corruption efforts, health, education, and infrastructure. Through OGP, citizen participation should become institutionalized in decision-making, by, for instance, amplifying the voice of citizens in shaping policy; leveraging digital platforms to crowdsource citizen feedback on government performance; and incentivizing governments to respond.
• Broaden collective ownership domestically – A key priority is to broaden collective ownership and coordination of national OGP processes across cabinet and line ministries to reach broader groups of civil society. OGP also seeks to welcome and to integrate new actors, such as local governments, legislatures, private sector, the media, and youth.
• Strengthen capacity, coordination and coalitions for implementation – The OGP wants to address implementation gaps that may cause potentially transformative OGP commitments to fail to come to fruition.
• Raise collective ambition globally – The OGP wants to foster collective action across OGP countries to scale up transformation in areas that governments have been keen to learn from each other about – areas such as beneficial ownership, political corruption, open data, open contracts, citizen engagement in budgets, and service delivery.
• Review OGP’s rules of engagement and performance incentives – OGP’s incentive structure should encourage innovation and risk-taking, whilst discouraging inactivity and lack of ambition.
• Strengthen OGP’s branding and communications – OGP’s communications strategy should support the sharing of best practices, give credit when transformational reforms are implemented, and galvanize a movement of OGP reformers internationally, nationally and locally. Over the next five years, OGP should move to position itself as the main global actor, convener and thought leader for open government reforms.
My take
I’m not entirely surprised by the strategic refresh sought out by the OGP. Whilst ‘open government’ has quickly garnered support from plenty of countries globally, I haven’t seen plenty of evidence that the commitments laid out are transformative. I’m basing that on my experience here in the UK, which should be leading the pack, considering it was one of the founders. Signing up to principles and then embedding them in the processes are two completely different things. Good on the OGP for recognising that it needs to take things further.
