This morning I stumbled across an article on Medium written by Robin Chase, one of the co-founders and former CEO of Zipcar, entitled “Bye, Bye Capitalism. We’re Entering the Age of Abundance”.
It grabbed my attention given that I have previously written about the sharing economy, where I suggested that in its current form it could be interpreted as a bit of a ‘capitalist con’. The idea being that whilst these new networks allow people to extract value from their existing assets, they ultimately still create monopolistic platforms that receive a cut for having to do very little.
People (the ’employees’) think they’re on to a good deal because it’s ‘better’ than the deal they got under traditional corporate structures, which have been exacerbated by the poor economic conditions – but ultimately it’s a very similar arrangement, except these new networks don’t have to offer you much legal protection and they don’t have to invest in many assets of their own.
At the time I wrote:
And this leads us to one of the most critical points of all – whilst these platforms appear to be helping society at large, convincing us that we are taking the power of earning into our own hands, via this new wonderful mechanism known as the ‘sharing economy’, what it could be doing is quickly breaking down what has protected us as workers within these capitalist, money making structures.
In a way, in the past we have made an exchange, whereby we accepted the capitalist idea of ‘big business’ because we thought it gave us benefits in terms of employment. A job market with endless earning opportunities and securities. However, what the sharing economy is arguably doing is giving us ‘big business’ without some of the employment benefits.
Robin Chase
However, Chase, one of the instigaters of this sharing economy model through the creation of Zipcar, believes that these new networks will transform how businesses run in the future and will end capitalism as we know it. She writes:
Capitalists will tell you that we are driven by self-interest and thus incapable of sharing. But, I think self interest will drive us to share everything.
Companies, governments, and people who understand this new “Peers Inc” paradigm won’t build anything else. They will grow faster, learn faster, and adapt faster. The companies and governments that fail to share and connect, will fall farther behind. We are witnessing the end of capitalism as we know it. Nothing can or should hold us back.
Again, I would like to add at this point that I don’t think these networks are ‘sharing’ anything. Sharing is a term that implies letting somebody else use something that you own for free. The likes of Uber and AirBnB are putting the capabilities in place to connect people that want to lease or rent their assets – it’s not sharing, its an extension of the traditional trading we see within capitalist economies.
That’s not to say its bad, not at all. It’s just not the end of capitalism or a sharing utopia that so many, especialy those with huge marketing budgets, pertain it to be.
However, Chase does note that the ‘sharing economy’ as it currently stands leaves people open to market abuse and this should be addressed. She says:
They break the old employer-employee work patterns, and with it, the logic behind the last hundred years of tax, work, and social-safety-net laws. This is the tension underlying lawsuits against Uber (and if we are honest,Walmart and Fedex have played the same games). To support a productive, equitable and sustainable economy we need benefits tied to people and not jobs. We need rules that protect individuals from the power of monopoly platforms. We need the resulting incredible productivity gains to be shared by all with a basic citizen’s income.
The good news is that the collaborative economy can address climate change and put people at the center of innovation. We must be proactive to insure this. Instead of being fearful of unemployment, underemployment, income inequality, and the impending zero-fossil-fuel economy, let’s identify and actively deal with these issues. I know first-hand that the collaboration of people and platforms — Peers Inc — can deliver a better world.
Why no co-owned Sharing Economy networks?
Which begs the question, why isn’t anyone establishing a ‘sharing economy’ network that is co-owned by its providers of the service? For example, wouldn’t an Uber-type network that was co-owned by the drivers be better? It would offer some level of protection to those drivers, but wouldn’t stop the network form thriving.
We’ve seen this model exist and work well in the ‘physical’ world in the form of UK retailer John Lewis, which combines the principles of big business with co-ownership, where all of its employees have a stake in the company and are rewarded for its success.
When I tweeted I was writing this story earlier today, Matt Balantine, a technical advisor to the UK’s
Uber is the poster-child for the sharing economy
Government Digital Service and someone that helps organisations understand the impact of technology, sent me a link to something he wrote that echoes my thoughts. In a post dubbed “The John Lewis of Tech”, he wrote:
Being public is a problem for a tech company. For as long as you are making a profit, it’s very difficult to make dramatic, cannibalistic changes in business strategies. Introduce new product lines by all means, but don’t kill the old otherwise you risk the wrath of the shareholders (whose priorities are often in the short term).
This leads to an amplification of the Innovator’s Dilemma and it seems that a firm needs to be near death’s door before it can do anything (see: BlackBerry) or take itself private to make significant change (see: Dell). Both existing customers and shareholders are holding you to your existing technologies, making it easier for new entrants to steal a march on the next waves of innovation.
Imagine the flexibility a partnership in trust model would give to a tech firm: shared reward on an equitable basis leading to greater motivation and performance combined with private ownership giving much greater agility to take new tech directions when they were needed, not when they were too late.
Equally, Jerry Fishenden, one of the leading voices on technology in the UK, working across the private and public sector in senior IT roles, recently wrote an opinion piece on CIO that highlighted similar points. He said:
Given these capabilities and the low cost of use of digital platforms, it’s disappointing that we haven’t yet seen the rise of a flourishing, sharing economy of John Lewis-like service providers that obsoletes the out-dated tycoon pyramid model. Where are the service-providers run as mutuals or co-operatives – a true sharing economy of not-for-profits or community interest companies that provide SaaS with high value microservices? At the end of each year the parties involved – taxi drivers, room renters, frequent customers, whatever – could share the dividends, with a core of funding reinvested back into the platform ecosystem to further refine and improve it.
Two factors are likely to catalyse such change: governments finally catching up and levelling the playing field, and the commoditisation of platform ecosystems. As this happens, it will challenge the out-dated pyramid models of the current wave of digital tycoons and help encourage an economic and social disruption genuinely worthy of the term “digital innovator”.
 Scott Cullen, founding member of UKShareCo, Head of Product & People at PawSquad and advidor to collaborative economy companies, agrees with both the comments above. Whilst he notes that the current collaborative networks give ‘workers’ an element of control and the ability to make money as and when they need it, they could be enhanced through a co-ownership structure.
He says:
“Co-ownership networks: Brilliant idea. Why on earth cab drivers of London haven’t chipped in £100 a head and built a shared-ownership version of Hailo/Uber rather then fighting regulation I’ll never know.”
If you want a visual representation of what these sentiments, the Nation released this image during the latter half of last year, which highlights the potential of what an Uber company could look like:

My take
Chase’s article is misleading because the ‘sharing economy’ does not imply the end of capitalism. Far from it. As the sharing economy currently stands, it is an extension of capitalist ideas and an effect of the current structures that exist. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I don’t think it’s beneficial to always prescripe a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ connotation to these things – but it’s worth highlighting what is actually happening.
The ‘sharing economy’ as it currently stands provides platforms to people that want to rent their time and assets, which in turn allows them to take a cut. You don’t really have to own anything but the platform itself.
However, whilst the likes of Uber are lobbying to make the sharing economy a feasible alternative to what exists in the market today, this could leave room for a new type of network to be created that is co-owned by the people providing the service.
I don’t know why a driver would drive for Uber if it could drive for a network that it had a stake in and where it was being rewarded for the success of that network. These networks may be hard to build if it required a huge investment in assets, but as we know, the assets are already owned by the people that want to partake in these networks.
Whether or not a network like this could grow and scale and make money, whilst competing with the loss-making likes of Uber on price, remains to be seen. And that could be the biggest barrier to creation.
But it’s an idea worth considering, surely? If the likes of John Lewis, which is fundamentally a bricks and mortar business, can be successful in making money, provide stellar customer service and empower employees, its model that may just have a place in the sharing economy yet.
