There’s not much to fear from the Australian digital economy if Prime Minister Tony Abbot gets his way.
The guy who’s all for ‘stopping the boats’ by any means necessary to fend off asylum seekers has now offered up his unique insight into teaching kids how to code.
Bill Shorten, the leader of the Labor Party and Australia’s opposition, asked Abbot if he would commit the government to supporting the push to have coding taught in every primary school in Australia.
Abbott’s response:
