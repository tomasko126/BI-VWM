With just six weeks to go until Black Friday (23 November), many retailers will already be working overtime to get their e-commerce systems ready to handle the online shopping frenzy that the day’s discounts are designed to inspire.
That’s just as true of retailers in the UK, where Black Friday is a relatively recent import, as it is in the US. On Black Friday 2017, for instance, the UK spent £1.39 billion online, up 12% on the previous year, according to research from IMRG, the UK’s industry association for e-commerce.
For many UK retailers, it’s the busiest day of the year. For their IT teams, it’s often the most stressful.
At online household appliances retailer AO.com, for example, group IT director Carl Phillips says he never wants to go through another Black Friday like the one he experienced in 2016. Nothing went badly awry on the day itself, he hastens to add: systems stayed up, performance was adequate, customers were able to make their purchases.
But three months of onerous and time-consuming preparations had left the IT team with very little energy to celebrate once the day itself was over, he says. During the run-up to Black Friday, regular load testing against the live production environment had to be conducted in the small hours of the morning, so as not to impact regular customer traffic. As a result, many staff worked unusual (and long) hours. New hardware needed to be bought, deployed and configured, in order to ensure that peaks in website traffic could be accommodated. The team was still making final tweaks to the environment in the week leading up to Black Friday. Says Phillips:
On the surface, it looked like we’d done a great job, like we’d come through the experience unscathed. But in the immediate aftermath, sitting in the IT director’s office and breathing a sigh of relief, we all realized what a tough journey it had been. If I’m honest, I felt like I’d been beaten up. It was a gargantuan effort.
An experience not to be repeated
Never again, was the general view from the IT team at AO.com. It was time to shift the retailers bespoke e-commerce platform, built in-house, away from on-premise infrastructure and into the cloud. As Phillips puts it:
Black Friday is hugely important for AO.com and, since 90% of our revenues from from online channels, it’s absolutely vital that systems stay up. But one thing that really bothered me was the opportunity cost involved in all of those preparations – all the time spent to deliver the bare minimum requirement, which is systems uptime, instead of on projects and initiatives that could have added a lot more value to the business, quite honestly. What we realized is that, with the predictable scaling that cloud could give us, we’d be in a better position to focus on that kind of work instead.
In early 2017, the decision was made to move the AO.com e-commerce platform to Amazon Web Services as soon as possible, leaving plenty of time to spare ahead of Black Friday 2017. In order to ‘de-risk’ the migration – since Phillips and his team had little experience when it came to running enterprise-class commercial systems in the public cloud – the decision was taken to perform a straightforward ‘lift and shift’ of the software, without making any significant architectural changes to it. On top of that, AO.com engaged managed services provider Claranet to help with the project, which ran from February to August.
Black Friday 2017 was a very different experience from its predecessor, says Phillips, although that’s not to say that the team was in any way nonchalant about its approach:
We still started early. Black Friday is always going to be a massive event for us – but the move to AWS meant the preparation work was just easier. We’d created a test and load environment in AWS, in addition to the live production environment, so we could carry out all the testing we wanted, whenever we wanted, without affecting customer traffic. We could iterate on testing, we could carry out load tests at different times of day – but none of it needed to take place out of hours.
And when we needed to provision hardware – well, that wasn’t a problem. It’s all automated, so we’ve very much ticked that box on the checklist of things we wanted to achieve with this cloud migration. We went from very volatile provisioning lead times for on-premise hardware that could stretch from days into months in some instances to a matter of minutes through auto-provisioning. I’m pleased to say that, these days, if one of our servers starts misbehaving, we can just destroy it and another server will pop up in its place automatically.
The result was that, once the first big rush of the day was over, Black Friday 2017 was a day much like any other for the AO.team. Staff were even able to get on with other work, says Phillips, rather than spending hours hunched over monitors, waiting for disaster to strike.
Looking forward
AO.com’s migration to the AWS cloud has also had some interesting longer-term ‘halo’ effects, according to Phillips. It’s been a real catalyst for the adoption of more Agile and DevOps practices, he says. Time saved on provisioning hardware is now spent on architectural improvements. In software terms, the team is now making around 120 live changes to the e-commerce platform per week, compared to 75 per week before the move to AWS. Continuous deployment is now a realistic aspiration for the team and the work of re-architecting the e-commerce platform to be less monolithic and more based on micro-services is already underway, in many cases using AWS’s Lambda and WebAPI serverless technologies.
Now, of course, it’s time for AO.com to face Black Friday 2018. How does Phillips feel?
I think we’re in a good place. We’ve made further changes this year that I feel stand us in good stead, like switching our content delivery network [CDN] provision, which has given us some performance advantages, and taking on new DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attack protection. We’re not resting on our laurels. All in all, I’d say I have just the right amount of worry about it all to be healthy, I suppose – but no more than that.
