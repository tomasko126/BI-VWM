As it waits to hear early next month if its planned takeover by Oracle goes ahead, NetSuite turned in third quarter numbers that saw losses down, but a miss on revenue  expectations. 
NetSuite posted a loss of $34.1 million against a year-ago loss of $37.3 million on total revenue of $243.9 million, up 26% year-on-year but falling short of the $249.9 million expected by analysts. 
Recurring revenue from subscription and support was up 23% year-on-year to $190 million, while non-recurring revenue from professional services and other of $53.9 million, up 41% year-on-year.
Oracle has set a deadline of 4 November for NetSuite shareholders to approve its $9.3 billion takeover offer. That deadline is an extension following the declaration by T. Rowe Price, NetSuite’s second-largest shareholder with 14.5 million shares, that it opposes the deal, arguing that it underprices the firm. 
In an indication perhaps of the impact of the uncertainty resulting from that intervention, NetSuite says it now doesn’t expect to hit its targeted revenue outlook, which was set in the range of $955 million to $975 million. No updated guidance was offered. 
The firm cancelled its analyst conference call to discuss the results, citing: 

the announcement made on July 28, 2016 regarding NetSuite’s entry into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Oracle.
