SuiteWorld 17, the first NetSuite plus Oracle customer event since the latter acquired the former, turned out to be a well oiled and well received affair.
Over the course of the conference, Derek duPreez, Phil Wainewright and Madeleine Bennett published 12 stories, eight of which showcased a diverse range of customer outcomes from NetStute implementations. From memory, that’s the largest percentage of customer stories (excluding video) we have published coming out of a single event. Brian Sommer provided his signature take on the event.
