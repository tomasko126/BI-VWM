Joe Cowan at Insights 2016
Epicor just got acquired by KKR for a rumored $3.3 billion, a bit better than a deal it rebuffed a few years ago. What happens next? First  bit of history.
Epicor has a storied history going back to 1972, the same year SAP was founded. I recall a memorable customer event in Hawaii – who wouldn’t – where you just sensed that there was nervous excitement but something not quite right. That was 1999 if memory serves, a time when most of us were caught up in the Y2K maelstrom. Epicor was doing well, positioned as one of the main mid-tier players among manufacturers, logistics and retail customers. Then it all started to go pear shaped.
By 2011, the wheels had well and truly come off. A series of stalled releases and stalled growth left the company vulnerable to acquisition and in 2011, Apax Partners swooped in and took the company private in complex multi-company merger designed to create an at scale business that could compete head to head with the likes of Infor.
Things didn’t get much better for a couple of years although the company did manage to stabilize product. In 2013, Joe Cowan turned up as CEO. He has a history of reshaping companies to get them ready for sales and in 2014 it was thought a sale would happen. According to reports, Epicor posted a $20.8 million loss on revenue of $994.9 million in 2014. Fast forward and Epicor’s retail piece was spun out last year and $2 billion in debt acquired.
Regardless of the way you spin it, that’s a lot of turmoil for any company. Today, Epicor is trying to put the past behind it, concentrate upon customer friendly messaging while cautiously talking up its cloud story. It was with that backdrop that I spoke with a couple of Epicor executives at the company’s recent Insights customer conference. Before getting into the meat of those conversations though let’s be clear. Epicor is still winning business. It may well have a large chunk of change coming from maintenance for on-premises business but it is endeavoring to move the customer base to a more modern architecture.
What are the challenges?
Malcolm Fox, VP product marketing and a 20 year veteran with the company was candid in his answers. He talked to past issues where he felt that with the benefit of hindsight, the company got too far ahead of customers but didn’t respond by finishing off functionality in a way that customers could then consume. Fox talked of some of the frustrations involved in messaging for a business sector that doesn’t necessarily want or is ready to leap ahead with new technologies:
We were moving further away from the reality of where our customers are. I think a lot of what we’re trying to do at the moment is not “We’re coming up with internet-of-things and big-data and all this kind of stuff;” actually we’re trying to make it easier for our customers just to get up  to analytics, just to get to digital commerce and, frankly, trying to make it easier for customers to stay current.
To some extent those were, as executives admitted, self inflicted wounds and it is therefore unsurprising to have heard Cowan laboring the ‘customer is first’ point during his keynote. The difficulty I found was that Cowan isn’t a charismatic leader keynote presenter. He doesn’t have the salesperson’s energy and angst that’s needed to project a convoking image of passion. You can’t blame him, it was never his job and now that is done, we can confidently expect KKR to install someone who has those kind of smarts. Or can we?
Private equity is notorious for taking assets and then squeezing them until the pips squeak. That normally manifests itself in wholesale redundancies, maintenance price hikes and minimal product investment. In this case, I believe that would be foolish for a company that is only just emerging from its own turbulent past.
The knowledgable technical leads inside Epicor have a long history and understanding of how the product line works, including some interesting developments in cloud based technologies. This from Erik Johnson, chief architect about how Epicor approached cloud development:
It’s shared everything. We run on the metal, meaning no virtualizations whatsoever. We have an application server, we have database server. One database has all of the customer’s data in it at one time. We partition for the tenants in our application, but we do it natively in our app.
During our conversation Johnson talked in detail about how the company has changed a bunch of processes related to the way things are developed and how that translates into a fresh way of delivering solutions that, to my mind, is much more in keeping with the modern idiom of continual releases at a cadence the customer can consumer without it leading to custom code breaking. We also talked about other technical aspects under non disclosure but the impression I came away with was of an rejuvenated R&D operation, poised to deliver what their sometimes beleaguered customers need but without force marching them to an ideological cloud system.
My take
I sincerely hope that as the KKR team get their feet under the table that they see the assets on offer as much more than a cash cow. That would require investment where it has been most lacking – brand marketing and continued investment in the cloud infrastructure Johnson’s team is building out.
It is a sad fact that while I am covering this transition and providing insights into an event that was held over a month ago, Epicor is not getting the attention it might otherwise deserve. It is also a sad fact of life that marketing has a big role to play in any technology company’s success.
Here’s hoping that KKR see this as an opportunity and are prepared to put some judicious spend behind that element of what is in fact a decent company with products that are still relevant.
