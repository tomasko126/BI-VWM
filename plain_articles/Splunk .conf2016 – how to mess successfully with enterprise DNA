Some analogies chosen by IT companies to describe the underlying ethos of their products or technologies can be trite, some painfully embarrassing. But the theme that Splunk opted for as the strapline for its .conf2016 conference in Orlando’s DisneyWorld theme park actually seems particularly appropriate.
Data is the DNA of all IT endeavors, and the ability to log it, monitor it and make use of the results, is the key to building something more complex and functionally rich. It is easy to see that analogy holding true over time, though  it will need extending a bit. This year’s event showed that the company is working hard to meet what is needed.
Taking the analogy further, the convention included significant amounts of human DNA meeting and communicating with other serious amounts of human DNA, but doing it through many many levels of abstraction of the raw chemicals. Complete bodies, in other words, plus intellects  and both human and technological communication media were constantly employed.
What this means, of course, is that Splunk is climbing up the levels of abstraction itself and moving into the world of ever richer, more comprehensive services, rather than just simple tools for logging, monitoring and searching network traffic log data.
As Andi Mann, Chief Technology Advocate for Splunk and the company’s all-round security geek, said on day two of the conference, the DNA analogy maps very well onto the move towards digital transformation. For him, Splunk provides all the tools needed to make digital data the DNA of the business:

Digital transformation is powering a revolution, but it is also creating fragmentation. Instead of looking to specialist service providers, people are starting to do it themselves. Yo can also see it happening in IT. There is a braking down of old monoliths and creating new platforms, and this does create new problems such as  combining traditional best practices such as ITIL, with the new ones coming along such as DevOps.
This is an existential threat to IT teams. There is a need to make digital transformation an essential part of a company’s DNA. There is now a need for them to think about  the end to end activities – a need to focus on the complete service they want to create rather on bits of infrastructure.

To make this happen he sees the need for businesses to get into building services and applications that share a common data fabric that encompasses whatever kinds of data are being generated, and also wherever that data is to be found, such as silos, and regardless of the activities creating it. The move is now towards predictive data, and he sees Splunk as the transformative tool with which to manipulate that data into services and applications of value to the business.
He sees IT operations changing, as users start to use their data for more tasks . It is not dead and he does not see it developing into what he called a ‘no-ops situation’:

But it is definitely changing. Sysadmins are fast becoming automation engineers.

Changes and dangers
Some of this change is also having a growing effect on Splunk itself, and it is a change that could raise some problems for the company. For a start, some of the demos on show at the keynotes were targeting increasingly niche applications of the ways in which data can be cut and exploited, to the point where one had to wonder whether the company was falling down the rat hole of trying to develop and build every possible applications that crosses its collective mind.
The other danger in this process is that Splunk may start to succumb to the temptation of eating the lunches of its growing list of partner companies, most of which are exploiting the Splunk toolset to build specific solutions that hit the needs of specific marketplaces. One problem here is that some of those may have horizontal applications and are therefore well suited to the growing roster of tools the company is building on its own.
And those tools are already proving popular with end user customers as they bring together basic data monitoring and manipulation tools – that DNA of a business – into higher, richer levels of abstraction and functionality.
To be fair, there were no all new developments to be seen at this year’s event, but there were some significant upgrades to be seen, in particular with Version 2.4 of the IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) toolset. The aim here is to improve the `signal to noise ratio’ for end users in working with raw data. In this Splunk context this radio term is widely used to describe the ability to get identify and expose more of the valuable data in a network log compared to the rest of it.
This adds three new areas of functionality that are expected to help users build their own services more quickly. These are new anomaly detection capabilities to help users locate and identify those odd events that are often the key initial signs of problems starting to develop; the ability to manage such events intelligently;  and the provision of tools that give users end to end visibility across the whole business, wherever an event may be happening.
This gives users the opportunity to build dynamic service modules with at-a-glance problem solving, early warning on deviations, event analytics,  and simplified incident workflows. The overall goal, according to Mann, is to create an environment where partners can build additions to the overall platform that work straight out of the box.
The  company aims to make ITSI integrate with a wide range of services and to build new modules as they are needed. It will also be working with its partners to ensure integration with their offerings. For example, it is already working with SyncSort to bring mainframe data into Splunk  for the first time. This will allow users to integrate back office applications into the whole end-to-end monitoring environment.
With Amazon Web Services a major partner for Splunk, ITSI is now being used as the basis of a usage monitoring service, allowing users to monitor their use of AWS services and resources in real time, rather than waiting till the end of the month to get a nasty surprise.
Work-in-progress is a dev ops deployment environment that can identify where problems are happening and what is creating in them. For example, the development team may be working ok, but there is a problem with building the production code, so deployment is held up.
The other main area of development on the Splunk Platform is in security, and according to Monzy Merza, Splunk’s Head of Security Research, the whole move towards digital  transformation will also require all businesses to address the issues of security transformation. One of the ways the company is aiming to help this process is by providing a single set of security tools with which development teams can build tools for across the whole organization that. Once built and in service, these can be used by Level 1 support staff to solve often quite complex problems.
These tools come in the latest version of Splunk Enterprise Security, which now adds capabilities for security monitoring, detection and altering, incident and breach response, automation and orchestration, risk-based analytics, incident investigation and response, enriched security analysis with threat intelligence, adaptive response, and improved threat detection.
The goal here has been to create a single pane of glass management environment for security ID, monitoring and remediation in a way that shares the knowledge of security team. Using this, they should be able to spot a breach starting, block it, maintain the evidence of the breach, and spin up a replacement server to maintain business continuity.
Another important part of threat management is the updated Version 3.0  of User Behaviour Analysis. This provides behaviour-based threat detection, kill chain detection, and peer-group analytics capabilities. It also provides a new content update service,  where Splunk security teams, together with hardware and security specialists, collect and collate the latest threat information and deliver it to Splunk users.  
My take
The DNA analogy sums the position of Slunk rather well, while its development into the higher levels of abstraction does represent both a significant opportunity and a potential threat for the company. The chance that it will trip itself up by pursuing too avenues at the same time is now a distinct possibility. But the need for what Splunk can supply is great, and will only get bigger.
