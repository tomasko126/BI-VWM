With a 400 year history, Pickfords is the oldest brand I know in the UK and the biggest in the removing business. They’ve always been a premium service but I’ve never used them myself. Until now. We had considered Pickfords a few years ago when thinking about an international move but determined the overall cost of both removing and then returning would be too high given we knew we were on temporary secondment. Back then, a surveyor turned up and walked through the house for an inventory check. The price is then based upon what you’ve agreed is being moved, locations and shipping methods. Today, there’s an option for a video survey.How does that work?
You make an appointment via an inline form, you get an email confirmation and a reminder on the set date at which time a Pickfords rep calls you up on your smartphone. At that point, you are in a video call with a smiling representative who then ensures your phone settings allow them to see what they need. The rep wanted me to change from portrait to landscape mode but for some reason my phone wasn’t having any of it. Surprisingly to me, the rep understood my device and was able to walk me through a method of changing the phone’s image orientation. Usually in these cases, I find that reps are insufficiently skilled to accomplish that task. We soldiered on.
Walking from room to room, I explained what was going, what was staying, what needs dismantling and what boxes need taking. At that point, and with all the explanations out of the way, the call is ended and the rep the prepares a quotation which is emailed back. I guess the whole process, including the unsuccessful screen mode problem solving took no more than 20 minutes.
The quotation was detailed enough that both sides know what’s happening and I got a chance to ensure that everything discussed was indeed included. I had a query on one item and we soon cleared that down via a phone call. I was also concerned that the overall price was much higher than comparable quotes. Sure enough, we got a reduction. The price is still more than I would have paid elsewhere. So why did I end up choosing Pickfords?
Let’s step back.
Alternative removers in the shape of Anyvan had provided me with a range of quotes. Anyvan acts as a market where removers bid for specified jobs. In this case, you have to enter all the items being taken, adding in any additional details such as dismantling etc and then sit back waiting for quotes.
Sure enough a pile of quotes came back but only one firm sought to ensure they had cleared down any queries they had about access, dimensions of the one item that needs dismantling and re-assembly etc. Even then, I didn’t feel comfortable.
Sure, there were plenty of reviews for each service provider but if I’ve learned anything, it’s NOT to trust most reviews. It is too easy to game these things. Also, reviewers don’t provide enough information with which to make a valid assessment. Telling em that ‘Joe did a fantastic job’ is no good without context. And I was also concerned that despite all the Q&A, I’d still end up getting stung with extras.
Pickfords on the other hand has digitized its analog service. I already know the brand, I felt comfortable and was surprised at the ease and speed with which the entire transaction was handled. In short, they provided a delightful buying experience, even at a premium. Now then…Pickfords hasn’t executed on the service. That comes in a short while. So things might just change but somehow I doubt it.
A useful side note. On the call, I complemented the rep for the service and asked if this method means she can work from home. She said that while that was true, it also meant that she can service customers at whatever time of the day that is convenient to them. This contrasts with the need for surveyors to travel. The efficiencies this leads to are obvious. It’s a clear win-win.
Does this mean that Pickfords storied brand is protected from upstarts like Anyvan? No. There will always be a segment of the market that wants low cost with good enough service and I’m sure Anyvan (and others) can readily fill that need. Pickfords on the other hand has a strong overseas and corporate business that these new services should ensure are protected for the time being. The real risk comes once the likes of the upstarts realize the value of a video survey in the buying experience and incorporate something like that into their offering.
Is Moving as a Service a thing? It sure is and falls firmly under Phil Wainewright’s XaaS moniker.
