Oprah’s campaign
Earlier this year, it looked as though the Oprah Winfrey factor wasn’t having the intended turnaround effect on Weight Watchers that it was intended to.
In the intervening months, things have improved somewhat, with a 4.8%  increase in subscriber numbers to 3.1 million. The real significance of that is that it’s the first upward tick since 2012 and it’s being attributed to a combination of the Oprah association as well as the use of Weight Watchers own Connect social media channel to create a digital community to mirror the offline meetings. 
There’s still a lot to do of course. The company this week turned in its 13th consecutive quarterly decline in revenue, down 4.7% in the quarter to $306.9 million, as well as a loss of $10.8 million, twice the loss reported in the comparable period last year. 
That leaves CEO James Chambers emphasising that this is a long game: 

Recall that in 2013 we embarked on a multi-year transformation confident that we could address our challenges, turn the company around and create a platform for sustainable growth for the future. Our plan was centered on creating a consumer-driven company, enhancing our insight capabilities and improving how these insights translate into an improved product offering and more effective marketing.
We committed to turning our technology environment from what was a legacy anchor into an enabling asset, improving our innovation capabilities and lowering costs. Our strategy also included targeting ways to better empower our meeting leaders and coaches, a competitive advantage of thousands of dedicated successful role models who have lost weight on Weight Watchers and kept it off.

To that end, the firm created a dedicated social media offering, Connect. This is, says Chambers: 

a social media platform embedded in our app where in a uniquely positive space members provide encouragement, share experiences and results and ideas about how they are living the program. Connect has been a home run with nearly 500,000 members actively participating on the platform since launch. In the U.S. alone, each day members connect with more than 9,000 posts, 40,000 comments and 200,000 likes.

One regular use is Oprah herself, who’s been combining digital outreach with real-world visits to subscribers. Chambers explains:

Oprah’s been engaged with her fellow members in the Weight Watchers community sharing her experiences through mega-conference calls, emails and by posting on Connect. Recently she attended a WeightWatchers meeting in New York, surprising and delighting the members who were unaware that she was going to join them. 

This was streamed via Facebook Live and resulted in one million views over the following 24 hours, which can only encourage Weight Watchers enthusiasm for all things digital. 

Chambers says that digital investment was necessary: 

When we put forth the transformation plan, we knew, and everyone knew, we were working in a huge market with unmet needs. We knew and everyone knew that Weight Watchers as a program works and it always will. 
But the world was changing and, frankly, I don’t think we quite keeping up and a big part of that had to do with technology and how that was having an impact on our online business and our digital tools in general. So a big focus in launching our transformation and driving it to be a more consumer-driven company with improved experiences was to bring ourselves up to speed as you’re referencing and improve our digital offering, and we’ve been working hard on that.

Digital transformation brings additional insight into consumer attitudes as well as enabling the offline and online experience to be more accurately mirrored, he adds: 

It provides us a great strategic advantage for understanding what really makes people successful in this more holistic pursuit of losing weight and eating healthier. And that has to do with being connected to other people.
We are experiencing that every week in tens of thousands of places and learning from that in our meetings room. We’re able to bring that towards our digital experience in a way that not only is going to be a cooler app, but it’s going to make people more successful, which is really what matters. 
A great example of that is the Connect feature that we put into the digital app recently where, in a totally positive way, our members can reinforce each other, they can share what they’re going through, they can share what has worked for them, and it’s been hugely, hugely positive.

He concludes: 

So on the one side we’ve improved our core technology and what it offers us and allowing us to innovate more quickly, and over time we’ll be lowering our costs. 
On the other hand we’re leveraging into the digital realm all of the strengths of what we have learned in the face-to-face business to make not only the digital product stronger, but the digital tools as they support the face-to-face meetings business stronger.

My take
As we’ve noted before, Weight Watchers has been a company whose business model has been disrupted by digital technology, most notably the rise of the wearable fitness device. The firm has realized and admitted to its mistake, but now finds itself playing catch-up. 
The Oprah impact that was supposed to occur last year didn’t manifest immediately, but it does seem to be kicking in more now. The canny use of Facebook Live caused a stir and we can expect to see more of this going forward.
There’s still a long way to go for the turnaround to be complete and no sense of timescales. Or as Oprah puts it in the advertising – If not now, when?
