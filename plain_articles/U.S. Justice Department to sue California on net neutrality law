An hour after California Governor Jerry Brown signed the nation’s toughest net neutrality legislation into law on Sunday; the Trump administration announced that it will sue California in an effort to block the law that requires big internet providers like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T to treat all web traffic equally.
The new California law prohibits Internet service providers from blocking or throttling access to sites and services, slowing down web connections or charging companies for faster delivery of their movies, music or other content. Smaller web firms worry that they do not have the resources to pay telecom giants to make sure their content is seen. The law also bans carriers from exempting apps from counting toward consumers’ data allowances each month (“zero rating”) if doing so might harm other companies.
California and several other smaller states had taken the step of writing their own net neutrality laws after the Federal Communications Commission dropped nationwide protections last year, citing the supposed regulatory burdens they had caused for the telecom industry.
The FCC’s recent repeal of federal rules said that states aren’t allowed to impose net neutrality rules, and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, not coincidentally a former lobbyist for the big ISPs, had called California’s net neutrality bill “illegal” and said:
The broader problem is that California’s micromanagement poses a risk to the rest of the country. After all, broadband is an interstate service; Internet traffic doesn’t recognize state lines. It follows that only the federal government can set regulatory policy in this area. For if individual states like California regulate the Internet, this will directly impact citizens in other states.
Pai has described the national net neutrality rules imposed during the Obama administration as “government controlled Internet” and the California bill an “illegal” pursuit by “nanny-state California legislators.”
After the bill was signed into law, its sponsor Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco said in a statement:
Net neutrality, at its core, is the basic notion that we each get to decide where we go on the Internet, as opposed to having that decision made for us by Internet service provider. It’s also about ensuring a level playing field for ideas and for businesses trying to compete. Today marks a true win for the internet and for an open society.
One hour later, the DOJ filed suit in Sacramento federal court to enjoin the law. The 11-page complaint argues the law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and is preempted by federal law. Attorney General Jeff Sessions added his two cents in a statement:
Under the Constitution, states do not regulate interstate commerce—the federal government does. Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy. The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today, but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order
Net neutrality now joins climate change and immigration on the list of big issues that are now being legally contested by the federal government and California, which the DOJ has taken to court already for trying to bypass the Trump administration’s policies.
My take
This is, at heart, a political war in which the future of Internet regulation is at stake. It pits the big telecom providers against internet tech companies. The Googles and Amazons can hold their own but thousands of startups and smaller sites, like the crafts site Etsy or the streaming service Vimeo, may not be able to afford to pay to make sure their content is seen. Consumers lose easy access to sites that don’t, or can’t, pony up. It’s sort of like the Mafia guy who says “Nice web site you got here. Too bad if something happened to it.”
FCC Commissioner Pai issued this smarmy, misleading statement:
Not only is California’s Internet regulation law illegal, it also hurts consumers. The law prohibits many free-data plans, which allow consumers to stream video, music, and the like exempt from any data limits. They have proven enormously popular in the marketplace, especially among lower-income Americans. But notwithstanding the consumer benefits, this state law bans them.
So, this whole business is about consumers and low-income people and not at all about allowing the telecom business to control how we use the internet. Nope. Not one little bit.
