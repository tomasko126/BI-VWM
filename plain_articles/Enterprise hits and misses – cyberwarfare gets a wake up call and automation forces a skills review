Lead story – The world badly needs a cyber-warfare truce – what are the chances? by Denis Pombriant
We’re in uncharted waters here.
That’s how Denis sums up the state of cyberwarfare – and the need for a truce. Key nation states aren’t inclined to agree. Denis warns:
By mid-century there could be half a trillion Internet-connected devices, many running vital infrastructure without direct human control and open to the possibility of hacking. The threat of people or nations acting with malevolent intent to control these devices, especially moving or flying devices, poses an unacceptable risk to global society and the time to prevent that scenario is right now.
Reader Clive Boulton took issue with Denis’ argument. Clive:
About zero chance for a cyber-warfare truce.
But:
I do hope industry analysts can continue to help translate catastrophic cyber-risk and the crypto-commerce solutions into awareness.
Yep. Whether that leads to awareness I couldn’t tell you. But even if a truce is an idealistic goal, Denis’ next step is hard to argue with:
We should consider developing international organizations and protocols that stem the proliferation of hostile acts of information terrorism.
It’s a challenge Pombriant should extend to software vendors and concerned CIOs of all stripes. Otherwise we’re stuck in security-breach-reactive-mode.
Diginomica picks – my top four stories on diginomica this week:

5 digital enterprise trends in the future of coaching networks (2/2) – “Coaching networks” might sound like bland executive speak, but it’s really about machines helping humans. Or, as Phil puts it, “harnessing AI and collaboration in an iterative feedback loop to help people achieve better outcomes.” Phil’s two part series lays the groundwork. Phil also analyzes five digital trends that are so important, I won’t issue demerits for his use of “game changing.” Meow!*
Is GDPR an opportunity to improve CX? Yes – if you do right by your data subjects – Barb opens up a thoughtful can of whoop ass offers constructive views for marketers on how to turn the obligations of GDPR into a customer experience win.
Online as retail theater at Harrods – I’m not sure what retail theater is, but I’ll bet its not waiting in the return line or typing in your credit card for eyes unknown. Martin’s nifty use case explains: it’s about transferring “the customers’ in-store experience of what he calls retail theater over onto the website.” Also: Stuart throws cold water in Macy’s Miracle on 34th St? Or just a boost from a real estate sell-off?

Vendor analysis, diginomica style. Here’s my three top choices from our vendor coverage:

Workday ends FY 2018 on a roll but Wall St frets over billings – Tell me if you’ve heard this one before: Workday posted better-than-expected Q4 2018 results, but its stock price slipped. Phil cleaves to the heart of it: “Wall St analysts mulled uncertain variability in future billings — a metric that Workday argues, with some justification, is tangential to its core numbers in a recurring-revenue business model.“
QuickBooks UK raises the stakes in the war for SMB customers – Den’s on the ground in London for this one. Stay tuned for customer stories as the accounting business (attempts to) transform.
Ansell avoids data synchronisation disaster by switching from MySQL to MariaDB – Derek’s first (but far from last) pond jumper of the year: the MariaDB user conference in NYC. Also see: MariaDB CEO takes aim at Oracle and launches new Labs.

A couple more vendor picks, without the quips:

Centiq COO Matt Lovell talks SAP HANA adoption in UK – improving but problems remain – Den
Dropbox IPO now on, first peek at finances, operations – Kurt

Jon’s grab bag – The misuse intimate exploitation leveraging of personal data by social media companies has reaching a boiling point of scrutiny. Derek weighs in with Why we need a single point of trust to calm nerves over social media data misuse. Meanwhile, Den’s got a use case on savvier use of social data in Headhuntr.io finds the ideal candidate in Nimble CRM.
Janine examines the problem of AI and bots covering over the sins-of-HR-past with Jason Averbrook in How ready is HR for AI? Here’s the bad news…. Mark Samuels wraps my diginomica picks with Great content means great customer experiences – some expert tips. “Make content the lifeblood of an organization“? We’re not quite there yet folks.
Best of the rest
 Lead story – Looking ahead – what jobs will technology take away? by Vijay Vijayasankar
myPOV: IBM’s Vijay Vijayasankar bravely wades into robots-and-jobs, but, happily, he’s not trolling us. He’s got his coaching whistle on, advising folks in automation’s path what the heck to do. He starts with context:
The world is sharply divided between people who believe AI and Robots (or automation in general) will take more jobs away than it creates.
Vijayasankar thinks automation will take away some jobs, but “there won’t be any net job losses.” I don’t agree; I believe swaths of automation will have broad/uneven impact and humans will be forced, not onto creative islands, but in survival-of-the-most-talented human/machine “coaching networks,” to lift a buzzword from above. But we’ve flogged that argument plenty. What matters is Vijayasankar’s tips to those in the fray. He issues cautions/advice for four types of jobs:

If most of what you know is public knowledge
If your work is all about short tail questions from a customer
If you are in a job where process trumps thinking
If your job is only about answering questions, and not about asking questions

In other words, if you are acting like a robot at work, or doing things machines can do much more quickly (like scour reams of legal documents – check this news story), your job is at risk. Agreed. A modern career is about pro-actively automating your job before your company does it for you, freeing up focus on that which can never be automated, at least not until the singularity. As Vijayansankar says:
If you have skills that can make [your employer] earn more revenue directly or indirectly, you get to stay employed.
Whistle blown. For most of our careers, that means 50 more push ups.
Honorable mention

Yes, Microsoft is doubling down on business applications  – Paul Greenberg stopped covering Microsoft last November. He explains why – and how Microsoft earned its way back into editorial relevance for its business applications.
The Quest for Agility Changes Buying Approaches – Gartner’s Hank Barnes on a surprising stat from their recent survey: 43% of enterprise software purchases were ad hoc buying efforts – “efforts that were not tied to strategic plans or existing budget commitments.”
Poor Relationships Line the Pockets of Your System Integrator – UpperEdge points out that even when enterprise projects fail, the systems integrators (usually) still make money. I don’t agree with the angle; in the long view, SIs must have successful projects or they will get flushed out. Lining pockets is hardly enough. Even if accountability happens over years, it does happen. But the tips for customers on achieving a better  project result are spot-on.
Why Artificial Intelligence Researchers Should Be More Paranoid – Another riff on last week’s 100 page downsides-of-AI report. One critical issue: how much of AI work should be exposed to the public/open source etc?
Tech Envisions the Ultimate Start-Up: An Entire City – “Silicon Valley wants to save cities. What could go wrong?” You mean, like Silicon Valley saved San Francisco? Hmm…
Philippine rural banks partner with UnionBank for blockchain – Yeah, another blockchain pilot. But for a technology it’s become fashionable to mock or dismiss, the amount of pilots are adding up. Still waiting for a PR rep to send me an actual customer though.
#NASSCOM_ILF 2018: An industry stuck in #fakenews limbo, desperately needing to change the channel – Another scorcher from HfS Research on the state of the IT services industry. If all goes as planned I’ll be hearing these informative tirades in person at an HfS event in NYC next week…

Whiffs

So Apple just confirmed that it uses Google Cloud for iCloud. Not a whiff, really, but – kinda awkward. I wonder what Siri thinks about getting two-timed like this…
As Josh Bernoff assessed, KFC handled their chicken shortage with some finesse, at least on the PR side (though he cautions that humor isn’t always a good way to go. In this case, self-mockery worked). More buffoonery:

Yeah, no need for notifications, they aren’t important. Delete app. Great job great effort @hootsuite. pic.twitter.com/3ARfU0muGk

A Twitter app without notifications? That’s kind of like a bull without…. nevermind. Hootsuite will be emailing me about this. Can’t wait for that. And no, Google didn’t escape with their iCloud coup:

Sometimes I like to howl into the wind. 🙂 This time a tribute to the UX design geniuses at Google…. pic.twitter.com/3awCU3WSZr

We’re all rats in an algorithmic maze, a science experiment executed to mass perfection. There’s no other rational explanation. I’m not going to politicize the column this week, but all tech readers can appreciate a scandalous “paper trail” tied to the inability to convert a Microsoft Word file to PDF.
Speaking of Microsoft, they’re getting sued for $600 million after a forced Windows upgrade “destroyed” a PC. I’m not sure how the plaintiff settled on $600 million, but Microsoft’s we automated the living hell of out of your improved-your-operating-system mantra sure carves deep into technoworker angst. Apple’s Mac line is down for the count, but Microsoft can’t issue the body blow because Cortana wants to sell you something while your system upgrades “in the background.”
Closer to the enterprise, I’ve got some rough news via Brian Sommer. We’re all about to get a crash course in cognification:

Because @jonerp loves tech speak – here’s one I got in an email “Cognification is disrupting the current business and operating models, and the way in which organizations look at the future. ” – Cognification??? Really? I better go and cognificate that one…..

As in:

Scene from a board meeting, err, design thinking workshop: Q:: “Why did our revenues dip 30 percent this quarter?” A: “We got cognified!” https://t.co/yuBqE2ach5

London got snowed under bigtime this week; I get the feeling we’re all going to get snowed from the keynote stage this spring…
* Enterprise folklore tracing back to SAP’s John Appleby suggests than any time the phrase “game changing” is used, somewhere, a small, helpless, buzzword-innocent kitten dies – an event that rings true – though none alive can bear witness.
