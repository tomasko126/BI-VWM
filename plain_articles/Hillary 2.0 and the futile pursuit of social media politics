Given that the subject of mobile devices is a somewhat touchy one for Hillary Clinton at present, it’s ironic that the would-be Presidential candidate chose Twitter to make the opening gambit of her 2016 campaign for office. But really, in 2015 is there any other way to make such an announcement? Apparently not.
She’s in
Clinton has 3.31 million followers on Twitter, well ahead of putative Republican rivals such as Jeb Bush (176,000) and Rand Paul (594,000). Interestingly, both the Republicans make much more use of Twitter in terms of numbers and frequency of postings. That we can expect to change as Clinton’s campaign team take control of her Twitter account.
While there’s a long way to go to election day, it’s clear that social media is going to play a large part in Clinton’s campaign as she seeks to appeal to younger voters. Her campaign team are also acutely aware that Barack Obama made astute use of social in his re-election campaign in 2012.
That last election broke key social media records with more than 31 million tweets sent during the campaign. Obama’s appearance at the 2012 Democratic National Convention spawned four million tweets during his 40 minute speech alone, while election night itself saw a peak of 327,452 tweets per minute as the TV networks called the race for Obama.
Those numbers will be shattered this time around. It is a very different world for this election. Pew Research points out that while just over a third of the US electorate owned a smartphone last time around, this time that number is over two-thirds.
Another tweet?
We’re also all far more used to Twitter and Facebook being sources of content and information to which we turn multiple times a day. This is prime communication real estate.
On the upside, political points can be scored and disseminated with ease. On the downside, so can faux pas such as Mitt Romney’s ’47% of Americans who’ll never vote Republican so we can ignore them’ moment from the last campaign.
So Clinton has been carefully building a socially-savvy technology team around her in preparation, most notably her recruitment of former-Google exec Stephanie Hannon as her Chief Technology Officer.
Hannon, formerly director of product management for civic innovation and social impact at Google, led project development of Google Wave. That was shut down three months after its launch. Clinton will be hoping for better results.
As of Sunday evening, Clinton’s candidacy tweet had been retweeted 90,000 times, her campaign video had been viewed more than 1 million views on YouTube, and her Facebook campaign page had almost 500,000 likes.
That said, for a few hours yesterday, the highest trending hashtag in the US was #Why Im not voting for Hillary.
Cautionary lessons from the UK
In the UK, the General Election to elect a new government is now less than a month away and while Twitter is providing a useful touchpoint for national sentiment, it’s not delivered a convincing lead for any of the main political parties as yet.
Despite Prime Minister David Cameron once famously declaring that “Too many tweets might make a tw*t” – a comment he’s never been allowed to forget and which you can hear here – both the Conservative and Labour Parties have invested heavily in social media outreach.
Research firm Ipsos MORI suggests that 34% of 18-24 year-olds in the UK believe their vote will be influenced by social media. In a close-run election race that currently looks as though it will fail to deliver a majority government, the apathetic youth vote could be decisive.
Actually there’s a lot of room for error here. In the run up to the UK election, the BBC has set up Generation 2015 in an attempt to be achingly relevant. While the chosen panel has not been entirely accepted as broadly representative of the youth vote across the nation (to say the least), they did have some interesting points to make on social media, the most telling being that tapping into Twitter and Facebook can easily become the online equivalent of ‘dad dancing’:
The voice of the youth vote?
Leaving aide the youth vote, it’s a mistake to rely on social media theory as somehow presenting a definitive picture of progress. For one thing, Twitter users are typically younger and well-educated and as such don’t provide a broad demographically representative picture. Only a third of the UK electorate are estimated to be on Twitter. That’s a big number but not as big as the two thirds that are not on Twitter. So while it’s useful to be able to reach that socially-enabled third, it’s crucial to make sure you understand the majority that are not.
Secondly, there’s a lot of ‘confirmation bias’ that can dominate Twitter as you follow those who agree with your point of view and as such get a potentially false reading. Right wingers use Twitter to mock left-wingers and vice-versa.
The Conservative view
The Labour Party view
There’s little in the way of genuinely constructive debate that might actually influence a swing-vote either way. Given that this particular election remains too close to call and will likely end up in a complicated coalition, social media’s not helping anyone make the big break through needed by the main parties.
A warning note to all parties should be taken from last year’s independence referendum vote in Scotland. On the night the results were to be released, Alec Salmond, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was seemingly confident of victory, in large part because he and his colleagues had become dependent on social media analysis that was just wrong.
An excellent analysis in the The Scotsman newspaper earlier this year explained:
At huge expense, and amid considerable secrecy, the former SNP leader had brought in polling experts from across the Atlantic. With their new methodology, they’d be able to give him the most detailed predictions yet seen in political analysis. Or something like that.
Unlike most traditional operators in their field, they placed great store on the use of social media among voters. By monitoring interactions on Face­book and Twitter, a fuller picture would be painted.
In the end, the fuller picture turned out to be a fake.
During the independence referendum last year, research suggested that over 80% of tweets were in support of the Yes campaign for splitting with the rest of the United Kingdom. On the eve of polling in Scotland, the Yes Scotland campaign had around 100,000 more likes on Facebook than the Better Together no campaign. Come voting day and the no campaign won a convincing victory and independence was dead in the water (for then!)
My take
This isn’t the election that will be won by social media in the UK, even though I’m going to receive many press releases over the coming weeks making that claim. But really, we tried this argument last time and the time before that come to that and it wasn’t true on either occasion.
The strangest things can tip an election. I’d old enough to remember when Conservative Prime Minister John Major defied expectations and won a second term in office and his most powerful communications trick was when he started standing on a soap box at public rallies. That’s what the parties need: their own John Major soap box moment – and they won’t find it on Twitter.
Dreamforce 2014
As for the US Presidential Campaign, well that’s a long road to travel. (There is a certain benefit in the UK Parliamentary democracy system that boils the election campaign period down to less than a month rather than 18 months or more.) Clinton has spent a lot of time over the past couple of years popping up at technology firm conferences like Salesforce’s Dreamforce. We can certainly expect a more tech-driven campaign than we’ve ever seen before – for better or for worse.
