Citrix, of course, is one of those long-standing companies that forms a core part of the legacy infrastructure for many enterprise users, so any shift in direction it displays is bound to have some impact on how those enterprises choose to manage their current and future operations.
At last year’s Citrix Synergy conference, in Orlando, the company announced that it had started to move into the cloud. And at this year’s event, in Las Vegas, the new CEO, Kirill Tatarinov, took things a fair bit further, stating that over the coming year users will see the company’s entire product portfolio move to the cloud.
He also announced two new developments which he sees as major moves to shift enterprises towards a more flexible, scalable and productive environment. These are Workspace as a Service, which pulls together all the major elements of the Citrix product line into a coherent whole, and a major upgrade of the company’s long-standing partnership with Microsoft that rolls in extensive use of Azure and Office 365.
And yet… it raised some wider questions that Tatarinov identified in his opening keynote, but his presentation danced around providing substantive answers or pointing any fingers. The primary question is, for many enterprises, one of increasingly fundamental importance – the continued stagnation in productivity across nearly all industrial areas, and the correlation of the significant growth in the use of technology to manage businesses. The loss to the economy produced by that stagnating productivity has been estimated to be $2.7 trillion.
Tatarinov suggested that there may be a causal connection between them, in that technology has created an ever-growing complexity that users have to face. This complexity is then compounded by the propensity of the tech industries to issue upgraded, updated bolt-ons – often lauded as `simplifiers’ – that can simply add to the complexity underpinning the delivery of any business process.
If even a percentage of such a staggering loss can be laid at the collective door of the IT hardware and software vendors then the industry as a whole needs to re-think its position. After, there does now seem to be some evidence that suggests users have paid good money to buy solutions that have cost them money in, if not lost, then un-gained productivity.
There is also the probability that the users have become so wedded to their legacy systems that there is now a reluctance to change that goes beyond `risk aversion’.
This is an issue Citrix is looking to address with its new announcements, but only goes part of the way. One of the issues here is that the whole of the tech industry has a case to answer in that over the years users have been pushed towards believing the old story lines about technology. The assumption that ever-more complex technologies will be the answer to every problem has been sold to them by the vendors to the point where users dare not believe that those old stories have past their sell-by date.
Yet the one most important step the industry could now take is to ‘fess up to its mistaken storyline and start telling users that they really do need to start making some serious, nay drastic, changes to their IT solutions.
Moving beyond `bolt-ons’
Tatarinov, to his credit, came much closer than than any IT industry CEO so far to acknowledging this issue and that changes did need to be made. But then the impact was reduced somewhat by the fact that many of the subsidiary announcements made at the event were for updated, upgraded versions of existing products – and therefore themselves just more bolt-ons liable to contribute to the complexity.
The two main developments introduced at Synergy do make serious pitches at reducing the complexity end users face. Both Workspace as a Service (which may find itself shortened to the slightly risky WaaS) and the upgraded (possibly 3.1 version) Microsoft partnership make serious efforts in that direction.
A third announcement also steps into arena, at least indirectly. Citrix has become a big fan of the Raspberry Pi, and not withstanding its intended market of young students learning to code, has engineered it into a pocket-sized no frills VDI client capable of delivering the latest applications and services to PCs that are well past their prime.
This leads directly to the $100 VDI workstation as a real tool for many business applications, and a real saving for those enterprises that measure seats by the thousand.
Equally as interesting, though still far too early in the development phase for any sort of announcement this year, is the Pi’s potential as a monitoring and management client for IoT applications. According to sources, the key targets are in healthcare and the domestic end of smart cities. As well as being used for both monitoring data upload and management and control downloads, the potential for developing and pre-packaging common end-user functionality is also being considered.
Could you use a WaaS
The new WaaS is a front end delivery vehicle for Citrix Cloud. It is designed to provide secure, on-demand access to the apps and data users need to work, wherever they are needed and on whatever client device is required. These on-demand workspaces from Citrix also give IT the ability to securely deliver and manage the delivery of services from a single, unified control plane. WaaS can be delivered as cloud services from Citrix Cloud, or deployed on-premises on hybrid IT infrastructure.
The Citrix Cloud services behind WaaS now unifies every major Citrix product needed to deliver a secure digital workspace. This includes all the favourite Citrix tools like NetScaler, ShareFile, XenApp, XenDesktop and XenMobile. A user’s individual WaaS can include any or all of these as required.
It can also be deployed on to any cloud or infrastructure of the user’s choice. This gives businesses the flexibility to meet compliance regulations by securing and managing their data and infrastructure in whatever way meets their regulatory environment.
The Citrix Cloud also provides management of an often ignored element, licence management. The recent addition of the Citrix License Usage Insights Service is specifically designed to help Citrix service providers manage their licence usage reporting.
Even better chums with Microsoft
One of the cloud services the Citrix Cloud runs on, according to Bill Burley, Citrix Corporate Vice President and General Manager, Workspace Services, is Microsoft Azure, as part of the extended partnership between the two.
Amongst the reasons for this, he told the Synergy audience, is that Skype for Business is now the Number One unified communications solution while 50% of all applications are now browser-based. In addition, with Linux now being used in 80% of enterprises, and sales of Google Chrome devices growing at 27%, strengthening the links between the increasing cloud service management and delivery capabilities of Citrix and Microsoft’s Azure and Office 365 services and applications was a natural step.
The Microsoft partnership covers Win 10, Office 365, private/Public cloud and mobility. According to Brad Anderson, Microsoft’s VP enterprise client and mobility, Win 10 has already appeared on 145% more devices than Win 7 at the same point in the lifecycle. In addition, 85% of enterprises are running pilot projects on Win10. Now the partnership has AppDNA for applications validation and a Win10 VDI service on Azure, which is an industry first.
With Office365 already widely used in enterprises, the partnership allows applications using plug-ins and macros to be delivered to any device. It also covers the delivery of Skype for Business as a VDI service. In addition, all the Citrix applications with be Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite enabled, including embedding the NetScaler VPN in EMS, and there is now Sharefile integration with Office 365, plus enhanced rights management capabilities.
Among the `bolt-ons’ that Citirix also announced at Synergy were new versions of XenDesktop, XenServer, NetSacaler CPX and Netscaler management and analytics system.
My Take
The move by Citrix to increase cloud-based coverage, especially in terms of both the Workspace-as-a-Service offering and the extended partnership with Microsoft, will obviously appeal to many enterprise IT departments under pressure to provide more cloud delivery capabilities. But it is perhaps Tatarinov’s productivity observations which make this Synergy the more memorable. He did not go so far as to lay any blame at the users’ door: he did not say `we’re offering, but you ain’t asking yet’. But the implication hung in the hall a good while. And if users don’t start asking and continue to stick with the old legacy ways, the question as to whether productivity will start to improve again or will hang there with it. Indeed, have users become addicted to complexity for its own sake?
