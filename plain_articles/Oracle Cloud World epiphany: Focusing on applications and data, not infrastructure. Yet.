Mark Hurd – co-CEO Oracle
Oracle has had something of a cloud epiphany. Regular followers of tech fashion will remember when Larry Ellison, co-founder Oracle, famously derided cloud computing as “complete gibberish” and an IT fashion fad. He was forced to acknowledge and react to the steady erosion of Oracle customers to SaaS and IaaS providers like Salesforce, Workday and AWS.
However, much like mid-life religious converts are often the most zealous, latecomers to technology trends sometimes become their most compelling advocates. At Oracle’s recent CloudWorld event, executives showed a company that has completed a U-turn by presenting some of the most forceful and savvy arguments for the business imperative of cloud services.
Go cloud or go away
Like IBM, the cloud has become a matter of existential importance to Oracle as its legacy business of selling software licenses and hardware products erodes in the face of a growing enterprise preference for usage-based application and infrastructure subscriptions.
In response, Oracle has fast become one of the strongest cloud advocates, with co-CEO Mark Hurd characterizing the cloud as a generational shift saying
…the cloud isn’t just about technology but about a business model [and] a new way of thinking about our industry.
Hurd emphasized that the argument for cloud computing has evolved from a focus on cost reduction and CapEx minimization to one about providing significant competitive benefits like better security, reliability, application customization and business agility. Expounding on the cloud as an “irresistible force,” Hurd said,
This is not a ‘what if’, or ‘let’s try something new’, this is the way things are going to go. The sooner you get on board with that, the better.
Hurd admitted that:
…in the short term, [the cloud] causes chaos in our industry, the one Oracle competes in …the change will not be linear, but exponential,
adding that Oracle expects 80% of the corporate data centers to vanish by 2025 as a like percentage of business applications and nearly all enterprise data moves to the cloud. Hurd expects the shift to cloud will be accompanied by a comparable increase in IT service development as budgets get drastically reallocated from maintenance and operations to innovation and development.
While the cloud disrupts Oracle’s business model, the company also sees it as an opportunity since Hurd expects companies using the cloud transformation to simplify their application and vendor portfolio by focusing on fewer providers that offer a full cloud application and platform suite.
If correct, Oracle’s future banks on being one of the chosen few since Oracle’s most recent quarterly report shows that its sales of new software licenses dropped 20% from the prior year, while hardware equipment and support sank 10%.
The good news is that Oracle’s total cloud revenue spiked 62%, however the $404 million increase didn’t offset the $439 million drop in new software and hardware sales. The silver lining is that, at 59%, the profit margin for Oracle’s cloud services is 25 points higher than its overall operating margin, meaning for every customer dollar Oracle can shift from on-premise hardware and software to SaaS, platform and infrastructure services, the company picks up twenty-five cents in income. By way of comparison, SAP reports its most recent cloud margin results at 64.8% in non-IFRS terms.
Not just an AWS wannabe
Oracle’s cloud success hinges on keeping current customers from defecting to the competition, particularly AWS which has been aggressively promoting its native database services like Aurora as cheaper, more flexible and better-performing alternatives. In his CloudWorld presentation, Thomas Kurian, President of Oracle Product Development argued exactly the opposite.
In comparing the Oracle Cloud IaaS with AWS, Kurian cited the company’s price-performance calculations showing that
You spend 20% less with Oracle, you get three-times as many CPU cores and between 7- to 10-times the performance.
There is good reason to think that Kurian is speaking truth to power. While dev and test environments frequently default to AWS and we know that vendors like Xero and Infor have staked their respective futures on AWS technology, on the ground customers say they do not necessarily get the economics they thought from operating AWS instances. The reasons are unclear at this time but if price is your only criteria then Oracle is making a compelling case.
Kurian highlighted the breadth of Oracle’s cloud offerings, including bare metal or containerized infrastructure (IaaS), application development platforms (PaaS) and packaged software (SaaS) and the tight integration between them. He also discussed Oracle’s hybrid strategy that allows any of its services to run in a private enterprise data center as a managed, pay-as-you-go service.
We take the exact same software — infrastructure, platform and very soon software-as-a-service — and make it available on your data center at the same price as in the Oracle Cloud. Same model: you pay by usage, you’re not buying a machine, you’re not making a capital purchase, you’re buying a subscription or a metered services that’s fully managed by Oracle.
Of course, no vendor event is complete without touting some customer case studies and Oracle trotted out several reference customers for its cloud services including GE, a perennial favorite of AWS. The company is famous for aggressively eliminating over 90% of its data centers, mostly for AWS, however it announced that Oracle Cloud earned its choice for GEs new ERP system.
IIt is important to note that while GE is a perennial reference favorite and has developed a tightly managed deployment methodology for both its SAP and Oracle application landscapes, GE is not necessarily wedded to specific technology. In customer meetings, Den Howlett  reports that some deployments are still very much of the POC style going to production rather than a ‘balls out’ commitment.
Oracle also updated the status of its infrastructure expansion, announcing three new cloud regions, making it 29 total, double that of two years ago. Building hyperscale cloud data centers is fabulously expensive and like AWS (and others) Oracle doesn’t detail how much of its capital expense (over $1 billion in the last six months) is devoted to data center construction, however its SVP of cloud development is quoted saying that Oracle already has enough cloud capacity to handle 99.9% of Fortune 1000 workloads. Most important, it throws off the kind of cash that lets it compete with both AWS and Microsoft.
Again, and as an aside, Bob Evans, who recently retired from a high profile position within  Oracle communications  in his Cloud Wars Ranking for 2017. ‘
My take
With its CloudWorld announcements, including the ability to run its eponymous database on dynamically provisioned bare metal servers, Oracle demonstrated its ability to continue innovating in a highly competitive market.
Oracle naturally focuses on database services and has a compelling business case by offering probably the broadest range of performance of any cloud provider. It starts with multi-tenant service at a couple hundred bucks a month, scaling up to a rack of hosted Exadata service with over 100 virtual CPUs, a hundred terabytes of usable capacity and 2-3 million IOPS; all using the same APIs and SQL code.
Unlike the two cloud contenders, Google and IBM that I previously profiled, and despite its growing cloud capability, Oracle is still more like Salesforce than AWS, with revenue from its SaaS suite five-x that of its IaaS products.
While SaaS revenue is required to replace declining software licenses, it doesn’t guarantee Oracle a spot in the shortlist of strategic cloud vendors as organizations redesign IT, business applications and digital services around cloud-native products. Thus, the importance of Oracle’s platform and infrastructure message since these are required before you become one of just two or three key cloud vendors Hurd expects most companies to have.
Still, CloudWorld showed that Oracle is making excellent progress in retooling the company. Indeed, it’s no coincidence that days after the event, Oracle announced plans to dismiss 450 employees from its hardware systems division.
While the rise of cloud competition like AWS poses an existential threat to Oracle’s traditional business, I agree with Hurd that the disruptive nature of the cloud’s utility-based usage and pricing model poses both opportunities and perils to all businesses.
Organizations that learn to best exploit access to unlimited computational resources, cheap storage, massively scalable data analytics and emerging AI and machine learning platforms will have a significant competitive advantage over those that persist in running a traditional IT shop. As Hurd says, “The sooner you get on board with that, the better.”
