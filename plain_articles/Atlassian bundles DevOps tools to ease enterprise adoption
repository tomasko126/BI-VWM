Atlassian, the collaboration and workflow tools vendor favored by many agile and DevOps development teams, yesterday launched Atlassian Stack, a pre-packaged bundle designed to support DevOps in the enterprise.
Noticing that its larger customers — those with 500 or more users — typically already use at least three Atlassian products, the vendor has created a bundle of all of its products, pre-integrated for use in a DevOps context and priced as a single line item for 1000 users or more. The bundle includes the flagship issue tracking system Jira, shared documentation platform Confluence, code manager Bitbucket, communication tool HipChat and identity manager Crowd.
These are server licenses intended for deployment on the customer’s own servers or data centre clusters, as this remains the preferred deployment mode among larger customers, according to Cameron Deatsch, head of enterprise growth, who briefed us in advance of the announcement.
Atlassian is also introducing a DevOps marketplace of third-party tools that work with its core products. At launch, there are 200 add-ons and integrations available from a wide range of vendors, including well-known names in the development world such as Splunk, AppDynamics and Sauce Labs. The range of capabilities offered includes alerting, build management, containerization, infrastructure automation, monitoring, release management, among others.
DevOps maturity model
Conscious that many organizations are relatively new to DevOps — and that adopting the right mindset and processes is just as important as having the necessary tools in place — Atlassian is also publishing new content to help educate the market. This includes an interactive DevOps Maturity Model, designed to help customers assess where they are on their DevOps journey, developed with its partner xMatters. This is based on five maturity levels:

Base — roles are siloed, customers and users have to report issues manually, code goes into production on a six-monthly cycle, there are no defined platforms and testing is manual.
Beginner — the organization is starting to plan changes to culture and operations. Code goes to production every month, there are standardized platforms and automated integration tests.
Intermediate — Cultural change is in progress, when issues occur, alerts are automatically routed. Code is now updated on a rolling schedule, platforms support automated configuration as code and automated deployment.
Advanced — Teams become cross-functional, issues are communicated across toolchains. Development teams are organized by feature branch. The platform supports performance scale testing and automatic acceptance tests.
Expert — Everyone shares tools and there’s an integrated issue tracking process. All developers work on a single trunk with no branches. The architecture is fully infrastructure as code and instead of testing being a separate process, experiments take place in production.

Those looking for further guidance can consult an ebook based on Atlassian’s own experience of using a DevOps approach. The existing Atlassian Team Playbook and Health Monitors are also available to help optimize team performance.
The new bundles are the culmination of two years’ work to provide a complete offering for enterprise DevOps teams, centered on the flagship Jira issue tracking system, which has become a backbone of agile development processes at Atlassian customers.
But although the DevOps movement is an important market for Atlassian, Deatsch is keen to emphasize the company wants to appeal outside of this audience too:
Our broader vision is to enable collaboration across all teams. While Devops is a major pillar we’re standing on, we’re trying to get outside of a technical audience and connect with a wider team.
We think the core to DevOps is a collaboration problem where we can provide a solution. We do focus on these DevOps teams but we provide a much broader offering than just narrowly defined as DevOps.
My take
Enterprises need all the help they can get to help them on the way to the DevOps model, and bundling all of its tools into a single, preintegrated toolset is a savvy move by Atlassian, which is a favorite of many DevOps organizations. Positioning this stack as a platform that supports an ecosystem of third-party tools is also an astute move that can only help consolidate its market presence.
But as Deatsch is cautious to note, the vendor’s ambitions extend far beyond the IT function, as it would like to see its products adopted throughout the enterprise. In that sense the DevOps market is a beachhead that it hopes will become a stepping stone to broader future adoption.
