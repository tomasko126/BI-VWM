On the day when the result of the American Presidential election was declared it was perhaps appropriate that Dheeraj Pandey, CEO of Nutanix, should observe that pundits often get it wrong. Most of the pundits had certainly got it wrong about Donald Trump’s chances and, as Pandey pointed out, in a more specific way those that pontificate about IT had been equally wide of the mark over recent years.
Pundits had said that convergence was done seven or eight years ago, he suggested, but then along came hyperconvergence, which he expects to see also converging cloud silos.
Speaking at Nutanix.Next in Vienna, the company’s first major conference outside the USA, he did credit pundits with realising that they do not know what cloud will be like in five to 10 years time, though he did indicate he feels it will be `dispersed’. Indeed, it might well disappear completely as an issue because it has only ever been a concept, not a product, and as a concept it will just become the `way’ services are consumed.
The one thing he felt sure of, however, was that the future will have one common feature with the present and the past.
We still laugh at what software could do 20 years ago.
The company used this first-time conference not to poke fun at pundits, however, but to set out its own vision of where the future is heading and the role it expects to be playing in getting there. And a key part of that role is to try to marry up what is still best about the on-premise world so familiar – and indeed relevant – to the world of enterprise users with the flexibility and agility that the cloud can now offer.
In particular, the target is marry up on-premise hyperconverged infrastructures with the type of service users get from Amazon.
1-Click
The keys to this marriage are seen by Sunil Potti, chief product and development officer at Nutanix, as one or two additions to Nutanix Prism, the management system that gives users an at-a-glance insight into server, virtualisation and storage resources available within an infrastructure. One is known as 1-Click, a fully automated toolset which allows users to upgrade and manage the whole Nutanix stack with a single click, or at most just a few of them.
The goal with 1-Click is to give users an Amazon-like experience in their own datacentre and private cloud. The key thing is that Nutanix has to be able to cater for end user choice, including in particular any type of hypervisor, to provide them with an application mobility platform. The need is to visualise and orchestrate network services. Users should be able to insert services as required, and network taps at any relevant point.
The other key addition is micro-segmentation, which will give users far tighter control over how applications communicate with each and, as a consequence, a new way of approaching some serious security issues.
1-Click is pretty self-descriptive. It was demonstrated, for example, building a typical self-service portal for staff, where they can go and self-provision the resource that they need to do their jobs. The tools allow users to build a range of such resources in the form of virtual machines by simply cloning existing VM types (defined by factors such as the number of processor cores, memory etc). These are simply renamed in ways that make sense to the staff, most likely a name associated with a task.

The building process – which in the demo suffered the near-standard glitches and delays found when using large venue internet services while working live with remote services – was still an acceptably short period of time. So normal business use should be quicker. And apart from the naming process, only a few clicks completed the task.
Staff can then simply log in to the portal, click on the required resource and power it up. End users with sufficient skill could readily configure the resources themselves, extending the degree of Amazon-like self-service even further.
The level of response from the conference delegates was very positive, and outbursts of applause greeted the individual demos despite the normal European reluctance for demonstrations of enthusiasm.
The other key development, micro-segmentation, aims to provide much richer control over communications within the datacentre. The goal here is to provide far stronger management of inter-applications communications so that only those communications that are explicitly permitted can actually occur. This provides users with better policy management over the service orchestration process.
It also speeds the setting up of new applications by automating the instantiation of the required tools and services each new application will require. This can be particularly useful when new applications are provisioned out to users, a task that normally requires a good degree of `hand-tooling’ by IT staff for each installation.
Security benefits
Micro-segmentation also provides an important side benefit of creating a level of security that is based on explicit process requirements than technology. One way hackers try to gain access to valuable data is by first infiltrating malicious code into a low-value application that is perhaps not so well protected.
The idea is to then rely on inter-applications communications, especially between web and database applications, to move the malicious code to a high-value application. Most often such communications are not required but occur anyway.
So the Nutanix solution is tools that separately ring fence the web and database applications. This then only allows those inter-application communications that are explicitly allowed by policy, governance regulations or similar definition. Everything else is blocked, even if a hacker finds a way of engineering a link between applications.
It will be interesting to see how much traction 1-Click and micro-segmentation gain in the marketplace, especially in the early days, for they are likely to appeal only to a minority of enterprise users. Potti noted during the presentation that enterprise applications that require a reasonable level of such elasticity are in the minority – around 25%. The majority 75% well-known and usually unchanging workloads using the same resources day in and day out.
The economics of cloud services usually means that these are still better run on-premise, though the recent partnership between VMware and Amazon AWS is expected to start to change that as enterprises explore the ability move unchanged binaries between on-premise and an AWS resource, creating hybrid cloud environments.
For now Nutanix still seems firmly set on the on-premise enterprise private cloud marketplace, though 1-Click should give the tools to help enterprise users jump into a hybrid cloud world, and one providing the needed elasticity, as they come ready for it.
My Take
There is a way to go before the established ways businesses can move their IT requirements into the cloud are well known and commonplace. But the chances are that the 1-Click approach now coming available from Nutanix will be amongst them.
