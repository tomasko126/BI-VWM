diginomica pick: How healthy is the cloud economy? by Stuart, Phil and Martin
quotage: “It was a rare example of a cloud services provider admitting that post-Snowden, data sovereignty concerns were impacting on its bottom line.” – Stuart
myPOV: In a trio of pieces, the diginomica team examined the relative health of the cloud economy, including a look at how cloud service providers are faring. The prevailing mantra is that Snowden’s NSA revelations have not significantly hurt cloud revenues, but Stuart is seeing evidence to the contrary. The above quote refers to Rackspace CEO Taylor Rhodes, who  acknowledged data sovereignty concerns when the firm recently lowered its revenue expectations for the current quarter.
Stuart also points to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), which estimated in 2013 that the NSA surveillance would cost cloud computing companies somewhere around $21.5 billion to $35 billion. Last week, the ITIF upped those estimates.  In Are Cloud Service Providers still not sure what they’re selling?, Martin looks at the dilemmas of cloud service providers, whose cloud migrations are not quite a spiffy as they might have us believe.
Martin examines new data from the Cloud Industry Forum, which polled 250 IT and business decision makers about their cloud migrations. Turns out many have found the transition less than straightforward (only 10% said the process could not have been improved).
Phil adds another angle in Has the UK’s G-Cloud reached a tipping point?, where he makes the case that the numbers from the UK’s G-Cloud on cloud procurement may not capture the full cloud impact. None of these pieces deny the economic impact of cloud. But the details are always more devilish than we think.
diginomica five: my completely subjective “top five” stories on diginomica this week

Customer rants and raves provide valuable data for Philips – There’s gold in vented spleen of customers – if you know what to do with it. Jessica’s got the story of one company that’s figuring it out. When you consider that customers who look at reviews on Philips.com generate up to 180% more buy-button clicks than those who don’t, this isn’t just a “thanks for your feedback” exercise.
Why not apply a personalized medicine approach to business? – A good question, leading to an insightful riff from Charlie Bess.
The Internet as ‘significant to evolution as the opposable thumb’ – So, have you heard of the term “screenagers?” Evidently that’s what we all are now, as we communicate via screens and literally screen each other with data. Derek shares highlights from author Andy Law’s London Technology Week presentation.
Retail disruption: Woolworth’s CEO resigns and The Gap is in trouble  – It’s not a super fun time to have thousands of retail locations as (mobile) consumers changing their shopping behavior. Derek looks at Woolworths; Stuart at The Gap. We’ll see how the expected “we’re investing in digital/data/omni-channel” approach works out for these two. Given the Stuart is a Banana Republic fanboy shopper (owned by The Gap), we can count on his updates.

Vendor analysis, diginomica style – In keeping with our cloud economics theme, Stuart applies the necessary nuance to Wall Street needs Larry to do the cloud math as Oracle’s numbers disappoint. Wall Street can be overly harsh with on-prem/cloud hyrid company valuations, but there’s a complicated story here that’s well worth reading. Den sparked the expected Internet brouhaha with Should SAP Open Source HANA? If you’re expecting a vintage Howlett rant, think again, the post is measured and lays out the issues SAP needs to think about, however far into open source they opt to go.
Phil takes on the other big #ensw news of the week in Will Microsoft buy into Dynamics or sell it off?. This story has caused debate. No one disputes that there is a major leadership shakeup in the Microsoft Dynamics leadership. What it means is the subject of debate. Phil thinks this sets up a sell-off off Microsoft’s legacy ERP assets. Too bad there’s not an enterprise software betting site where we could place a friendly wager.
Oracle isn’t the only “cloud transition” vendor to get a bit of a cold shoulder from Wall Street this week – Stuart’s got the story in Adobe’s cloud gamble is paying off, but laggards remain. We wrap the vendor coverage with an HR use case from Janine, Unified Workday system ties together HR and finance at ServiceSource.
Jon’s grab bag: Janine’s surprising Female CIOs win bigger budgets than male counterparts had some interesting notes on negotiating styles. I didn’t know that Twitter was delving into our subconscious mobile behavior, but Derek has learned otherwise (A look at how Twitter is measuring the ‘unconscious’ impact of ads). Beyond the intriguing title, Derek’s How digital services can not only make you feel sad, but also make you stupid also has some useful design takeaways. Plus he worked Tinder into a diginomica piece, which is even tougher than “trenchant” (ping!).
Stuart’s Beyond the Internet of Things – the birth of Living Services? was one of our most popular pieces of the week, though I’m not sure if “Living Services” has much hope as a buzzword du jour (and I cringed at the phrase “nearables,” the first time that word comes out of my mouth, please walk me off the plank please). And: if you’re feeling deprived of a Howlett rant, then try Friday rant: shitifying the airline traveler experience on for size. (and yes, “shitify” is in the Urban Dictionary, though perhaps not in Webster’s just yet).
Best of the rest
 Debating the changes at Microsoft Dynamics – with Frank Scavo and Mary Jo Foley
quotage: “It’s not a stretch to see how Dynamics CRM and ERP fit into CEO’s software and services-focused Microsoft. But it will be interesting to watch how Microsoft balances its newfound love for partnering with CRM and ERP rivals (hello, Salesforce) with its stepped-up focus on its own enterprise applications business.” – Mary Jo Foley
myPOV: Two more contrasting views to Microsoft’s Dynamics changes: Frank Scavo’s Microsoft Unbundles Its Dynamics Business Unit and Mary Jo Foley’s How Microsoft’s latest reorg will affect Dynamics CRM and ERP.  Scavo is firmly on the side that this announcement “puts to rest” questions about whether Microsoft would sell Dynamics, putting him in opposition to Phil’s take.
Foley, a veteran Microsoft watcher, is somewhere in the middle, leaning towards Scavo’s side. She also sees this as an integration of Dynamics within Microsoft, rather than sell-off positioning, but Foley does raise the question notes in her quote above – how much will Microsoft push its own enterprise apps versus its new partnership-fest?
Naomi Bloom raised an interesting point on Twitter: if savvy analysts like Scavo and Wainewright can read Microsoft’s tea leaves/announcements so differently, is that a good thing for Microsoft or its customers? I guess we can look ahead to an interesting Microsoft Convergence show. albeit in 2016. I’ll set the initial bets for Foley at 3:1, Scavo 5:1, Wainewright 7:1. Don’t be surprised if I take the long odds 🙂
Other standouts

IoT fails, IoT developers, and can older executives get code? –  a few takes on the ups and downs of coding, starting with 5 Reasons Why My IoT Startup Failed (bonus points for puncturing startup failure glamour). On the positive tip, 6 Steps Developers Need To Take To Harness The Internet Of Things is a concise gut check. Steve Denning’s Will Older Managers Ever Get Code? is Steve Denning’s round up to his 38,000 word (!) piece on agile and scrum. Bottom line: age is (mostly) a state of mind, not an impediment to grasping and implementing tech. I’d add: as long as you have a good chiropractor…
Open source, open stack (and HANA?) – Stephen O’Grady, one of the most reliable bloggers in the enterprise in terms of writing something actually worth the coffee you’re chugging, is back with What is OpenStack?, a pulse check of OpenStack’s viability in a hybrid cloud world. Then Vijay Vijaysankar does volley-and-serve (or is that serve and volley?) with Den’s open source HANA post in Open source Hana – some random thoughts. Vijayasankar differs with Den but there are areas of agreement in terms of the benefits of an open-sourcy business model.
Is Apache Spark worthy of the hype? Apache Spark has managed to rise above the big data hype circus – an impressive feat. But is it worthy? In Big Data Depends On Big Community, Not Big Money, Matt Asay interviews Dean Wampler of Typesafe on Spark’s progress. Then, in Spark On Fire: Why All The Hype? Doug Henschen directly tackles the issue of Spark hype, spurred by IBM’s Spark plans.

Whiffs
“Grab a pillow, and find a comfortable place to sleep next to the luggage conveyer belt” – just another week in United Airlines customer service. Another airline shocker: Airline Group Backs Away From That Whole “Carry-On Bags Should Be Smaller” Thing. Turns out consumers didn’t feel like buying all-new luggage after all. We have to put up with enough false cloaking of misery-rules in “safety” bullpucky already. Another bad idea circling the corporate drain…
Oh, and Heinz Is Very Sorry for Ketchup Bottle’s QR Code That Led to a Porn Site (why are they apologizing, exactly?) And: I’ve been meaning to write about this Barclay’s banker for a while, who sent out a scathing satirical email to new interns, which contained delightful “what your job will really be like” keepers like “I recommend bringing a pillow to the office (yoga mat works as well). It makes sleeping under your desk a lot [sic] more comfortable, in the very likely scenario that you have to do that.”
Unfortunately, our overly ambitious banker got fired from not one, but two jobs for his trouble (his next employer rescinded their offer). Whiff? That’s been a subject of some debate. He’s now a permanent part of Internet lore, but that doesn’t really help when you have to “go fish” on LinkedIn. My call: this doesn’t have to be a whiff – IF this guy can figure out how to apply the razor’s edge without cutting through his own professional skin.
Officially off-topic
So I didn’t have a dog in the “Jack Dorsey returns to save Twitter” meme – until now. BEARD! Oh, and I already came out on Twitter as a Taylor Swift fan – can’t help myself, now that she’s talking tough to Apple when many of her musical peers are too gutless to do so. And.. she won this round (Apple is now paying musicians during the three month trial, and personally called her to tell her the news). Ergo, now I must apologize to the “empowered customer” crowd. We have one empowered customer, and, as Stuart points out, her name is Taylor Swift… and “We never go out of style!” (baby!)
On the complete other spectrum on the rise and fall of musical fame and fortune, Mike Reno of Loverboy has done these funny commercial spots where he recants his famous proclamation that “Everybody’s working for the weekend”, now that job site Indeed.com is liberating peeps from soul-crushing work. Shameless, yes, but remember, he’s not an empowered customer and Apple isn’t returning his tweets.
Meantime, in this week in robots, “Pepper,” billed as the world’s first robot that can read emotions, goes on sale on June 20. Though you’ll have to move to Japan. The struggles over censorship, diversity, and harassment over at Reddit don’t get the attention of any of Facebook’s shenanigan’s, but I’d argue that the enterprise lessons of Reddit are fascinating and relevant to community/ecosystem thinking.
So last week’s final word on cover songs that utterly replace their originals sparked some Twitter feedback (thanks Chris Kim). Kim argued for Hendrix’s “Hey Joe,” which is a no-brainer (I picked “Watchtower” instead). Jamie Oswald and I kicked this around and I’m going with blaspheme here, but The Fugees absolutely owned Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry” (and as Oswald points out, they took over “Killing Me Softly” also).
I also forgot about Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” which surely falls into this narrow category. And while it doesn’t replace the original, this stirring punk rock version of Don Henley’s “The Boys of Summer” by The Ataris is what a great cover is all about (“I saw a Black Flag sticker on a Cadillac”).  Rock on…
