Rackspace
Taking nobody by surprise, Rackspace is heading back to private ownership, having scored a $4.3 billion deal with private equity firm Apollo Global. 
It’s a move that’s been on the cards since the 2014 departure of CEO Lanham Napier. Under pressure from Amazon, Rackspace has explored various options, not least its alliance with Microsoft over Azure. 
Once safely in private hands, the question will be what the next steps should be. Rackspace’s public cloud efforts have faltered against Amazon and Microsoft, with nearly 3/4 of revenues coming from just managing servers for enterprises. That’s a conservatively safe business to be in and it may just the sort of thing that private equity backers want to tap into. 
On the other hand, the exciting opportunities may well lie in selling services into the Microsoft and Amazon markets. 
Molly Gallaher Boddy of analyst firm Technology Business Research (TBRI) sums it up well when she notes:

Rackspace is choosing not to compete as often with the largest public cloud providers, but rather to partner with them and support their customers. Going private will give Rackspace the time and space it requires to further develop this services-centric cloud road map without reporting to Wall Street. Going private also will enable Rackspace to increase spending as it invests for the future.
Additionally, Rackspace’s decision to take the company private aligns with a larger trend in the cloud market, as numerous companies have gone private in an attempt to redefine and expand their businesses. Examples include Dell, Marketo and Ingram Micro, which recently purchased Odin.
She adds that Rackspace might learn from Dell’s experience:
Dell provides perhaps the best comparison to Rackspace as the vendor used its privatization to transition its image away from that of a struggling PC company, instead capitalizing on long-term growth more in line with where the market is headed. Dell was ultimately able to bid to purchase EMC, which will greatly expand its enterprise footprint, but constitutes a costly investment with significant implications for the success of the company.
Whatever the case, the next phase for Rackspace starts here.
