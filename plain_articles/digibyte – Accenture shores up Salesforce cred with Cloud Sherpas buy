Today Accenture has over 2,700 Salesforce-certified professionals. It will soon have another 500 after the firm chose day one of Dreamforce to announce plans to take over Cloud Sherpas, a services/advisory firm that specializes in Salesforce deployments.
In total, including its ServiceNow and Google, specialists, Cloud Sherpas employs 1,100 people, who will shortly join Accenture’s Cloud First division, which Paul Daugherty, Accenture’s CTO pitches as:
a game-changer that offers transformational cloud services to help clients move their businesses to the cloud and achieve significant business results more quickly.
It’s a move that appears to have the blessingl of Salesforce, with President Keith Block quoted in the official announcement as stating:
The combination of two strategic partners is exciting for our ecosystem and proof positive of momentum around our Customer Success Platform. This move further highlights how our world-class platform is helping ecosystem partners like Accenture and Cloud Sherpas innovate and deliver phenomenal levels of transformation and success for our customers.
My take
Phil will be providing an in-depth analysis to this development tomorrow following a meeting with Cloud Sherpas CEO David Northington. In the meantime, check out his interview with Northington from earlier this year.
Disclosure – at time of writing, Salesforce is a premier partner of diginomica.
