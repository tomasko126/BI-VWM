Some connectivity is definitely better than none.

That was the response Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook last week following the backlash his Internet.org project faced in India after its launch. But is some connectivity really better than none? It’s very hard for someone like me, who can’t remember not having full internet access, to be an unbiased judge – but I still remain largely unconvinced by Zuckerberg’s claims. This post will attempt to explain why.
For those of you unaware, Internet.org is a Facebook-led project that aims to put a number of curated “basic internet services” into the hands of citizens in the developing world that can’t afford unlimited data plans, for free. By partnering with mobile operators, and by Facebook and other selected services taking on the cost of the data (a concept called Zero Rating), Internet.org users will get free access to some internet services in a bundled app.
Zuckerberg puts this down to philanthropic endeavours and argues that more people on the Internet – or should I say, using services on the Internet carefully chosen to be important enough by Facebook – will be a good thing for economic and social progress. After all, two-thirds of the world remains unconnected and a lot of people living in emerging markets can’t afford the data plans being pushed to them by the mobile operators.
When Internet.org launched, Zuckerberg wrote in the Wall Street Journal:

A recent study by Deloitte found that expanding Internet access in developing countries would create 140 million jobs and lift 160 million people out of poverty, and that this newfound opportunity would even meaningfully reduce child-mortality rates. Across sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America, the Internet will help drive human progress.
Perhaps the most important change might be a new global sense of community. Today we can only hear the voices and witness the imaginations of one-third of the world’s people. We are all being robbed of the creativity and potential of the two-thirds of the world not yet online. Tomorrow, if we succeed, the Internet will truly represent everyone.
Nothing about this future is guaranteed. The coming years will be a battle to expand and defend the free and open Internet. Our success will determine how far this vision of a connected world can go. Connecting the world is within our reach, and if we work together, we can make this happen.

Problems in India 
However, as you can imagine, Internet.org has seriously irked net neutrality supporters and those in favour of an open internet. And it’s easy to see why – confusing Internet.org with the Internet itself may become a reality in some areas of the world, if peoples’ only experience of the Internet is the curated services by Mark Zuckerberg. There is a definite walled garden.
But Internet.org has been ploughing ahead and has launched in a number of countries, including Ghana, Colombia and Kenya. However, last week’s launch in India didn’t quite go to plan, which has again brought into question integrity of the motivations behind Internet.org.
Following its launch in the region, a number of the partner services that ended up on India’s Internet.org app  – including media partner Times Group and travel portal Cleartrip.com – decided that they were going to pull out. Not only this, but more than 800,000 people have sent emails to India’s telecom regulator demanding that it ensures a free, open and fair internet.
The backlash led Zuckerberg to respond with a co-opted article in the Hindustan Times, in which he argued that net neutrality and universal connectivity must co-exist and that Internet.org was a good delivery mechanism to achieving that. He wrote:

We fully support net neutrality. We want to keep the internet open. Net neutrality ensures network operators don’t discriminate by limiting access to services you want to use. It’s an essential part of the open internet, and we are fully committed to it.
Net neutrality is not in conflict with working to get more people connected. These two principles – net neutrality and universal connectivity – can and must coexist.
To give more people access to the internet, it is useful to offer some services for free. If you can’t afford to pay for connectivity, it is always better to have some access and voice than none at all.
Internet.org doesn’t block or throttle any other services, or create fast lanes. We will never prevent people accessing other services, and we will not use fast lanes. We’re also open to including all mobile operators in Internet.org, and we’re not stopping anyone from joining. We want as many internet providers to join so as many people as possible can be connected.

Confusing Internet.org with the Internet
And to these points, I do sympathise with Zuckerberg’s agenda. I can imagine that for many people having a couple of online platforms on which to have a voice, for free, would be beneficial. We have seen how people that have been suppressed in countries and regions have used services like Facebook and What’s App – both of which are obviously available on Internet.org – to mobilise and share information, which wouldn’t have been possible previously.
Which is why I feel conflicted. However, despite these tangible benefits, I still think Internet.org isn’t broadly a good thing. It skews competition. It’s not transparent. It doesn’t give people access to information outside of the services listed. And it isn’t the internet.
My primary concern is that Facebook has given up very little information about how these ‘free basic services’ are chosen and what the process is for deciding one over the other. For example, Bing search was chosen for Internet.org in India, instead of Google, despite Google delivering better local results for the region. Has that got anything to do with Microsoft’s stake in Facebook? Well, we don’t know. Largely because little information is shared about the selection process – Zuckerberg just keeps touting the same line that Facebook doesn’t choose the services by itself, but it also works with mobile operators and government agencies to decide.
And we all know that a handful of monopolies working together to decide what is best for the people always works out, right? (Note sarcasm)
I came across an interesting blog called “Net Neutrality in emerging countries”, written by an author called Vinrach, which goes to the heart of the problem. The blog states:

Most websites of internet.org are the sole representatives of their sectors. For example cleartrip.com is the sole representative of a travel website. Hungama.com is the sole representative of a music streaming website. Bing is the sole representative of a search engine.
Most websites of internet.org are chosen in such a way such that no two websites compete in the same space. The lone exception here are babajobs.com andtimesjobs.com both of which compete with each other. Apart from babajobs.com and timesjob.com I personally don’t find two websites that are in direct competition with each other.
The present structure of internet.org is such that it promotes monopoly in a particular segment and is a clear violation of Net Neutrality.
Internet.org targets people like these who own a smartphone but don’t have a data plan. Most people using internet.org use internet for the very first time and don’t have any clue of how vast the internet is. The users of internet.org are confined to the selected websites and think that the 20-30 websites of internet.org is what the internet is made up of. Everytime a user tries to jump across the walled garden of internet.org,they are stopped from doing so because of the data charges applicable for non-internet.org websites.
If this continues over a period of time the user would make internet.org his or her definition internet and would never try to explore outside the walled gardens of internet.org. This in turn would restrict the meaning of internet for the user to internet.org.

And this is the problem. We could end up in a very dangerous situation if a significant chunk of the world’s population, billions of people, conflate the idea that Internet.org is the Internet. If that happens we are in a situation where Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are essentially deciding what services – and what information – huge swathes of people should get access to.
These are not the principles on which the Internet was founded upon.
Adding in the fact that we know very little about the selection process for Internet.org, it becomes a system that is open to abuse. And I’m sure that’s not what Mark Zuckerberg’s intentions are. I don’t think he necessarily is being entirely opportunistic, I’m sure he does want people without access to get access. But history tells us that if an unelected group of people/companies are running things, behind closed doors, it’s a recipe for disaster.
In response to Zuckerberg’s piece in Hindustan Times, Savetheinternet.in, an organisation campaigning for net neutrality in India, wrote a piece that (perhaps more aggressively than I would write here), which sums up my feelings towards the project. It states:

Internet.org is a proprietary and secret Facebook initiative to ensure its competitors, and those of its “partners”, will face obstacles in reaching hundreds of millions of poorer users bought using the lure of “free”. Who selects the companies that get the benefit of zero-rating via Internet.org? What are the terms? Nobody knows, because none of that is publicly available.
What Mr.Zuckerberg wants, is to take away from telecom operators the power to discriminate against websites, only so that Facebook can wield that power instead. The Internet should be neutral, he insists, so long as Facebook is allowed to play kingmaker in between.
Mr. Zuckerberg’s ambitions become clear when, in his article, he says Internet.org is open to “all mobile operators” and “as many internet providers” as possible. Who does he not mention? Internet sites and mobile apps. Because the power to decide which of them get on Internet.org will rest with Facebook. Internet.org is not open, and despite its name, is not the Internet.

My take
A free and open internet is worth protecting. Some will argue that some information and some connectivity is better than none, but that’s not how the internet was intended to work.
