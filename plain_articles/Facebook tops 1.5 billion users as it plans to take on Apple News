At last month’s Chief Digital Officer Summit in London, Tanya Cordrey, CDO at Guardian News and Media, talked about the changing competitive nature of the news landscape:
The world is getting more complicated. We are still wrestling with the enormous changes in the competitive landscape. Not only do we have 1001 fantastic little start-ups nibbling at our feet, you also have the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple who have decided to park tanks on the lawn of news.
Those tanks are about to move further forward with the announcement that Facebook’s set to launch a news aggregator, reportedly to be called Notify, partnering with publishers including the BBC, the New York Times and NBC.
The app’s clearly a direct rival to Apple’s News app offering, but it’s also interesting as another example of traditional content publishers seeking to extend their brand reach online via third party social channels. With Facebook last night announcing that it’s now passed the point of having 1.5 billion users worldwide, it’s an obvious magnet for those with such ambitions.
For Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, that number is just one in a list of impressive stats that emerged yesterday as the firm announced third quarter numbers that saw a 41% year-on-year increase in revenues  to $4.5 billion and profits up 11% to $896 million. Other figures of note:

2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook.
Advertising revenue of $4.3 billion grew by 45% year-on-year.
Instagram has 400 million monthly active users.
More than 80 million photos shared on Instagram every day.
WhatsApp has passed the 900 million users mark.
Mobile monthly active users alone were 1.39 billion.
78% of Facebook’s $4.29 billion advertising revenue comes from mobile, which accounted for $3.35 billion last quarter.
8 billion daily video views on Facebook.
More than 500 million people watching daily.

Video and mobile
Those video numbers are of particular importance, says Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg:
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better. Marketers have always loved using video to tell stories.
Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach, but better cross-device targeting and measurement than we believe is available on any other platform.
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads saw higher reach, ad recall, brand linkage and likeability.
To share one example, GMC used video and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability.
As for mobile, Sandberg points to Instagram as a major contributor to creating a common ad infrastructure:
Our goal is to give marketers the highest return they can and over time to capture the amount of budget that’s equivalent to the percentage of media time we capture and we’re not there. Consumers have shifted to mobile and consumers have moved to Facebook and Instagram more quickly than ad budgets. And that’s the opportunity we have in front of us.
We have new ad formats for Instagram. We’re able to do more business objectives, all of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into feed-based products and we monitor it very carefully and we’re going to continue to monitor really carefully. We’re also excited about how they work together.
Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey using the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook and combining the two platforms that they’re targeting. We think we’re at the very beginning of what’s possible when we combine these two.
She adds that the spend on Instagram isn’t cannibalising spend on Facebook:
Some of the spend on Instagram is incremental to Facebook and some isn’t. Some clients are comfortable with Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear. Some clients are shifting some of their Facebook budget. For us in the medium to long run, we believe that we’re not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We’re competing with other forms of media. If you want the most eyeballs and we think the highest ROI, over time we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram.
What we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.
Direct response
Sandberg says Facebook continues to focus on the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads:
To share one example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only show them when their stores were closed and they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales which happened precisely when they want it to happen. That’s a direct response ad buy because it’s very specific carousel ads product ,but it’s also a brand play for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to.
As for the forthcoming Notify aggregator, it’s part of a wider push into news content creation and delivery. Zuckerberg says:
The biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience. When you go to load a video and it loads quickly, we made it auto-play to load even quicker. You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you’re on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load.
So the big initiative that we have here which I’m really excited about is Instant Articles and the big thing that that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time and that way when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously.
It can be a much more immersive experience and we’ve already found from the initial experiments that we’ve done that the engagement is positive and we’re starting to roll that out more broadly.
He adds:
I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things: news, video, search and the different experiences there. These are some of the big areas that we’re investing in and they’re long-term investments. They’re big investments and we’re going to keep on pushing on them, but I think that’s what we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect everyone in the world.
My take
Not much to complain about there.
