Airbnb has finally announced how it is going to try and address the racial discrimination that some of its users experience when trying to book a stay at one of the listings on its platform.
The company, which connects hosts with a property to rent and those looking for somewhere to stay, has been criticised for not doing enough to address the racial bias of some of its users.
The hashtag #Airbnbwhileblack exploded on Twitter earlier this year after a man called Gregory Selden filed a lawsuit against Airbnb, stating that he had been unfairly discriminated against when trying to book a property, because he is black.
Selden’s experience has led others to share their experiences on line, with many claiming that they too had been unfairly dismissed by hosts because of their race. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky admitted in the summer that “three white guys” hadn’t considered how their start-up might play into people’s biases when they launched the company.
A competitor platform has even been launched by two entrepreneurs – called Innclusive – that promises people a platform with places to stay, without the fear of racial bias. Innclusive has built in a number of features from the start that limit the chances of this happening (such as the removal of photos on profiles).
A review
Airbnb has been quick to admit there is a problem and in June announced that it would review every aspect of the platform to ensure that the company is doing what it can to fight bias and discrimination. Part of this included asking Laura Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington D.C. Legislative Office, to lead the process.
This week Chesky emailed all Airbnb hosts and guests, outlining the steps it is going to take to try and curb the problem. The report written by Laura Murphy, which you can read in full here, highlights a number of changes to the platform’s technology that are aimed at addressing the discrimination taking place.
Chesky’s email reads:
At the heart of our mission is the idea that people are fundamentally good and every community is a place where you can belong. We don’t say this because it sounds nice. It’s the goal that everyone at Airbnb works towards every day – because we’ve all seen how when we live together, we better understand each other.
Discrimination is the opposite of belonging, and its existence on our platform jeopardizes this core mission. Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them. Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. I take responsibility for any pain or frustration this has caused members of our community. We will not only make this right; we will work to set an example that other companies can follow.
Some of Airbnb’s new policies and changes include the following:
• From the 1st November, anyone using Airbnb will be asked to affirmatively agree to a new commitment before they book a listing or share their space on the Airbnb platform. The commitment states that “no matter who you are, where you are from, or where you travel, you should be able to belong to the Airbnb community”.

Agreeing to this commitment also means agreeing to Airbnb’s new strengthened and more detailed nondiscrimination policy. It claims that these rules are stronger than what is required by law.
A permanent, full time product team of engineers, data scientists, researchers and designers have been put in place, whose sole purpose is to advance “belonging and inclusion and to root out bias”
Encouraging the growth of Instant Book listings. Instant Book allows certain properties or rooms to be booked immediately, without prior approval by the host. Airbnb has a goal of making one million listings bookable via Instant Book by January 2017.
Airbnb has said that its new product team will experiment with reducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process and enhancing other parts of host and guest profiles with objective information. However, Airbnb hasn’t committed to removing photos all together – despite requires.
An Open Doors policy – if a guest is not able to book a listing because they have been discriminated against, Airbnb will ensure the guest finds a place to stay.
Airbnb has also committed to making its workplace a more diverse and representative environment. It will introduce new training to help people learn how to fight bias and it will mandate that all candidate pools for senior-level positions include women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

There report states that this won’t be the end of Airbnb’s efforts:
These changes are only Airbnb’s frst steps. Fighting discrimination will require constant and
ongoing work. The internal working group that produced this report will continue working
to both implement these initiatives and evaluate additional steps Airbnb can take to ensure
the Airbnb community is truly fair for all.
Will it be enough?
Whilst Airbnb should be applauded for taking steps and making commitments to address the racial discrimination within its community, it’s hard to tell whether or not the steps will make a measurable difference and deliver results.
A study by Harvard Business School earlier this year, which looked at 6,400 different listings in five cities in the US, found that guests that were perceived to be black were 16% less likely to be accepted for a listing by a host. So there is plenty of room for improvement.
Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer at Fusion, an online publication that aims to represent voices outside of the white-dominated media bubble, questions whether or not the measures are enough. He says:
The problem with these proposals, though, is that they don’t go nearly far enough.
Hiring more people of color is a great first step, but doesn’t mean all that much if those people merely become statistics for Airbnb to boast about in its next transparency report. What’s more, holding up a handful of black employees as proof of how “diverse” a company is only addresses the issue of diversity in the most definitional (and ultimately meaningless) sense.
Airbnb is also ordering its employees to go through “mandatory anti-bias training,” but that isn’t enough either. Despite all of the fanfare they get, workplace diversity trainings have been repeatedly shown to actually cause more harm than good.
There are similar problems with Airbnb’s measures to combat racism among its hosts and users. Telling people not to post pictures of themselves for fear that someone might deny them the chance to rent out an apartment because of their race isn’t a solution to racism–it’s a poorly-applied Band-Aid with no adhesive. Also, it puts the onus on the people being discriminated against to solve the issues being caused by bigots.
Rather than trying to sweep race under the rug or trying to ignore the fact that people operate with racial biases, Airbnb can and should just penalize people for treating each other badly the way its competitor Innclusive does. If a host repeatedly cancels on potential renters of color while also agreeing to rent to white people, flag their accounts. It’s as simple as that.
Equally, Innclusive has taken to Twitter to suggest that the latest measures still won’t be as effective as the changes it has introduced on its platform. See below:

My take
Airbnb needs to keep working on this. It needs to introduce the changes, measure the results and take any complaints of racial discrimination incredibly seriously. Eliminating racial bias out of a platform that relies on its users to make decisions on who they will host will never be easy – racial bias is incredibly prevalent in our society. However, if Airbnb finds that these measures aren’t working, they need to go further.
