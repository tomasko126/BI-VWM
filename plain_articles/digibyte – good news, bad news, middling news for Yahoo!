Marissa Mayer
Good news, bad news, middling news sort of a day for Yahoo! 
The good news – the firm managed to turn a small profit in the last quarter of 2016. 
The bad news – the Securitiex and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether the firm disclosed news of two major hacking incidents soon enough to its investors and the public. Yahoo! took two years to confirm a 2014 hacking incident last September, followed several months later by news of a separate attack that had hit more than a billion users.
The middling news – the $4.8 billion takeover deal with Verizon isn’t off, but it has been knocked back and its final form remains open to question. 
Broken down, Yahoo!’s quarterly numbers are also a combination of the good and the bad: 

The company turned in a $162 million profit. 
Overall revenues grew 15.7% year-on-year to $1.47bn.
Mobile and social advertising revenues were up 25% to $590 million. 
Search was down 6% to $821 million. 
Desktop revenue was down from $3.5 billion to $3.46 billion. 

The company said it is co-operating with the SEC on its investigation, while CEO Marissa Mayer insisted that security remains the firm’s top priority:


With security protocols and password changes in place, approximately 90% of our daily active users have already taken or do not need to take remedial action to protect their accounts, and we’re aggressively continuing to drive this number up. Our commitment to our users is unwavering, and we continue to be encouraged by their loyalty to us and their ongoing patronage of our products.

Meanwhile the Verizon takeover process is continuing, but will now be kicked into the second quarter before any prospect of completion. And at what price such completion might come, remains to be seen. 
My take
Verizon is set to report its numbers today, so let’s see what they have to say on the subject of their putative purchase.
