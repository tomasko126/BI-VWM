 I normally reserve things I regard as amusing for my buddy Jon Reed to riff in his weekly Hits & Misses but this one was far too good to let pass.
Whether true or not, you have to admit this is a classic case where the unthinking robot wasn’t given a filter that might have avoided this unfortunate set of choices.
Then I got to thinking what would have happened if we’d applied the same logic to our diginomica emails.
In my case it would have come out [email protected] – and of course some people might well ask the question – ‘And just how did he come to that bat shit crazy conclusion in that story anyway?’
Anyone else seen unbelievable or awkwardly created email addresses worth the giggle?
In the meantime, do make sure you grab Reed’s H&Ms – the strikethroughs alone are well worth the anticipation. As a teaser, I particularly like how he takes a soft swipe at our own Brian Sommer with:
That means happy camper cuddly misanthrope seasoned analyst Brian Sommer is in rare form.
You get the picture. Oh yeah – and Brian’s initials are BS. Go figure.
Happy Friday folks.
